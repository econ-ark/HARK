    "In the parameter dictionary above, we chose values for HARK to use when constructing its numeric representation of $F_t$, the joint distribution of permanent and transitory income shocks. When $\\texttt{IndShockExample}$ was created, those parameters ($\\texttt{TranShkStd}$, etc) were used by the $\\textbf{constructor}$ or $\\textbf{initialization}$ method of $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ to construct an attribute called $\\texttt{IncomeDstn}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you were interested in changing (say) the amount of permanent income risk.  From the section above, you might think that you could simply change the attribute $\\texttt{TranShkStd}$, solve the model again, and it would work.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's $\\textit{almost}$ true-- there's one extra step. $\\texttt{TranShkStd}$ is a primitive input, but it's not the thing you $\\textit{actually}$ want to change. Changing $\\texttt{TranShkStd}$ doesn't actually update the income distribution... unless you tell it to (just like changing an agent's preferences does not change the consumption function that was stored for the old set of parameters -- until you invoke the $\\texttt{solve}$ method again).  In the cell below, we invoke the method $\\texttt{updateIncomeProcess}$ so HARK knows to reconstruct the attribute $\\texttt{IncomeDstn}$."
