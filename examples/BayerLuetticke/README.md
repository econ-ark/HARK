This folder contains code that solves models from the paper of Bayer and Luetikke, "Solving heterogeneous agent models in discrete time with many idiosyncratic states by perturbation methods" found at:

https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=13071#

This folder contains preliminary work that has not yet been fully integrated into HARK.

The paper solves three models, represented here in three places:

A Krusell-Smith model with a single asset, [OneAsset-KS](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/HARK/BayerLuetticke/OneAssetCode-KS), which can be run by executing _SteadyStateOneAssetIOUs.py_ then _FluctuationsOneAssetIOUs.py_..

A HANK model with a single asset, [OneAsset-HANK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/HARK/BayerLuetticke/OneAsset-HANK.ipynb), which can be launched on MyBinder using [this url]([https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/HARK/master?filepath=examples%2FBayerLuetticke%2FOneAsset-HANK.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/HARK/master?filepath=examples%2FBayerLuetticke%2FOneAsset-HANK.ipynb)

A HANK model with a liquid and an illiquid asset, [TwoAsset-HANK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/HARK/BayerLuetticke/OneAsset-HANK.ipynb), which can be launched on MyBinder using [this url]([https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/HARK/master?filepath=examples%2FBayerLuetticke%2FTwoAsset.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/HARK/master?filepath=examples%2FBayerLuetticke%2FTwoAsset.ipynb)


Other content:

1) BayerLuetticke_wrapper.py creates a wrapper to the one asset version of BayerLuettike's code. 

This file:
   * Creates BayerLuettickeAgent and BayerLuettickeEconomy which are simple wrappers to BayerLuetikke's code, presently only the steady state part of this.
   * Simulates a BayerLuettickeEconomy with 10,000 agents in steady state

2) ConsIndShockModel_extension.py extends ConsIndShockModel to calculate and store a histogram of the distribution of agents.

The BayerLuettike code can also be run directly to recover impulse response functions to aggregate shocks.

The direct (non-notebook) code for which is found in the folder BayerLuetticke_code/TwoAssetCode

To run this code run the two files in order:

1) SteadyStateTwoAsset.py - solves the steady state
2) FluctuationsTwoAsset.py - solves the aggregate shocks and plots impulse response functions
