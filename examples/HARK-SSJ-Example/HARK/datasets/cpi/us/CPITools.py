    Finds cpi deflator to transform quantities measured in "from_year" U.S.

    The deflators are computed using the "r-cpi-u-rs" series from the BLS.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_year : int
        Base year in which the nominal quantities are currently expressed.
    to_year : int
        Target year in which you wish to express the quantities.
    base_month : str, optional
        Month at which to take the CPI measurements to calculate the deflator.
        The default is None, and in this case annual averages of the CPI are
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    deflator : numpy array
        A length-1 numpy array with the deflator that, when multiplied by the
        original nominal quantities, rebases them to "to_year" U.S. dollars.
