    "The `cycles` parameter has a more general use than was presented in the [Quickstart](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/examples/Journeys/Quickstart_tutorial/Quick_start_with_solution.ipynb) notebook. In general, it tells HARK **how many times the one period consumer's problem needs to be solved with the given set of time-changing parameters.** In our microeconomic case, these parameters are LivPrb and PermGroFac (as the discount factor,  the CRRA parameter and risk free interest rate are assumed to be stable).\n",

    "For both the finite and infinite-horizon settings, **the survival probabilities and income growth rates are different in each period** and consumer **never faces the same parameter's combination.**\n",

    "The cycles parameter can be used  by itself in the solution of the one period consumer's problem with time-changing parameters, or it can be used in conjuction with the `T_cycle` attribute, given an interest in simulating the model. As you will see in the examples towards the end of this notebook, the use of the T_cycle parameter is more straightforward."
