# This module defines consumption-saving models in which an agent has CRRA utility over consumption, geometrically discounts future utility flows and expects to experience transitory and permanent shocks to his/her income. Moreover, in any given period s/he is in exactly one of several discrete states. This state evolves from period to period according to a Markov process.

# %% [markdown]
# In this model, an agent is very similar to the one in the "idiosyncratic shocks" model of $\texttt{ConsPrefShockModel}$, except that here, an agent's income distribution ($F_{\psi t},F_{\theta t}$), permanent income growth rate $\Gamma_{t+1}$ and interest factor $R$ are all functions of the Markov state and might vary across states.
#
# The agent's problem can be written in Bellman form as:
#
# \begin{eqnarray*}
# v_t(m_t,s_t) &=& \max_{c_t} u(c_t) + \beta (1-\mathsf{D}_{t+1}) \mathbb{E} [v_{t+1}(m_{t+1}, s_{t+1}) ], \\
# a_t &=& m_t - c_t, \\
# a_t &\geq& \underline{a}, \\
# m_{t+1} &=& \frac{R(s_{t+1})}{\Gamma(s_{t+1})\psi_{t+1}} a_t + \theta_{t+1}, \\
# \theta_{t} \sim F_{\theta t}(s_t), &\qquad& \psi_{t} \sim F_{\psi t}(s_t), \mathbb{E} [F_{\psi t}(s_t)] = 1, \\
# Prob[s_{t+1}=j| s_t=i] &=& \triangle_{ij}, \\
# u(c) &=& \frac{c^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}
# \end{eqnarray*}
#
# The Markov matrix $\triangle$ is giving transition probabilities from current state $i$ to future state $j$.

# %% [markdown]
# The one period problem for this model is solved by the function $\texttt{solveConsMarkov}$, which creates an instance of the class $\texttt{ConsMarkovSolver}$. The class $\texttt{MarkovConsumerType}$ extends $\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ to represents agents in this model.
#
# To construct an instance of this class, the same attributes as for $\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ are required, except for one as described below:

# %% [markdown]
# ### Additional parameter value to solve an instance of MarkovConsumerType
#
# | Param | Description | Code | Value | Constructed |
# | :---: | --- | --- | --- | :---: |
# | $\triangle$ |Discrete state transition probability matrix  | $\texttt{MrkvArray}$ |  |$\surd$ |
#
# The attribute $\texttt{MrkvArray}$ is a $\texttt{numpy.array}$ of size ($N_s$, $N_s$) corresponding to the number of discrete states.
#
# Note that $\texttt{MrkvArray}$ is am element of $\texttt{time_inv}$, so that the same transition probabilities are used for each period. However, it can be moved to $\texttt{time_vary}$ and specified as a list of $\texttt{array}$s instead.
#
# The attributes $\texttt{Rfree}$, $\texttt{PermGroFac}$ and $\texttt{IncomeDstn}$ should be specified as arrays or lists with $N_s$ elements for each period.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Solve MarkovConsumerType
#
# When the $\texttt{MarkovConsumerType}$ method of a $\texttt{MarkovConsumerType}$ is invoked, the $\texttt{solution}$ attribute is populated with a list of $\texttt{ConsumerSolution}$ objects, which each have the same attributes as the "idiosyncratic shocks" model. However, each attribute is now a list (or array) whose elements are *state-conditional* values of that object.
#
# For example, in a model with 4 discrete states, each the $\texttt{cFunc}$ attribute of each element of $\texttt{solution}$ is a length-4 list whose elements are state-conditional consumption functions. That is, $\texttt{cFunc[2]}$ is the consumption function when $s_t = 2$.
#
# $\texttt{ConsMarkovModel}$ is compatible with cubic spline interpolation for the consumption functions, so $\texttt{CubicBool = True}$ will not generate an exception. The problem is solved using the [method of endogenous gridpoints](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/EndogenousGridpoints.pdf), which is moderately more complicated than in the basic $\texttt{ConsPrefShockModel}$.
