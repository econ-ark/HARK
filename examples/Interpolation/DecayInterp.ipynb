    "Suppose we have an interpolator $f(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that is set up over a cartesian grid. Denote the greatest points of the i-th dimension grid with $\\bar{x}_i$. Suppose we have some limiting function $g(\\cdot): \\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and we want to construct some enhanced function $h(\\cdot):\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n",

    "\n",
    "We might want to construct such functions if we are worried about the performance of our interpolator $f(\\cdot)$ when approximating values that fall far-off its grid. As demonstrated in Section 5.10 of [\"Solution Methods for Microeconomic Dynamic Stochastic Optimization Problems\"](https://llorracc.github.io/SolvingMicroDSOPs/) this situation arises when approximating the solution of consumption-saving problems: extrapolated solutions can have characteristics that are at odds with the basic theoretical properties of our problems. Fortunately, it is often possible to analytically solve the limiting version of these problems---for instance a version of a consumption-saving problem where wealth is infinitely larger than income---and to use these analytical solutions $g(\\cdot)$ to moderate the extrapolating behavior of our numerical solutions.\n",
