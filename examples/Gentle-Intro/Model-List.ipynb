    "\n",
    "This model is probably most useful for handling consumption dynamics with higher frequency than usual. That is, if you were to observe someone's consumption spending on a monthly basis, it would be (relatively) more volatile than their spending on an *annual* basis-- sometimes \"things just come up\" and someone needs to buy more in one month than another. The model can thus generate volatile consumption without even more volatile income."

That is, the solver code consisted entirely of specifying a class that inherited from both `PrefShock` and `KinkedR`.\n",
