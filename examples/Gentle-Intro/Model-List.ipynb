    "[`PrefShockConsumerType`](../ConsPrefShockModel/PrefShockConsumerType.ipynb) agents are identical to those in `IndShockConsumerType`, but they *also* draw a \"preference shock\" each period. These shocks are multiplicative on utility, representing how valuable consumption is *this period* compared to normal (shocks should be mean 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is probably most useful for handling consumption dynamics with higher frequency than usual. That is, if you were to observe someone's consumption spending on a monthly basis, it would be (relatively) more volatile than their spending on an *annual* basis-- sometimes \"things just come up\" and someone needs to buy more in one month than another. The model can thus generate volatile consumption without even more volatile income."

We chose this because the original solver for this model was a demonstration of multiple inheritance in our *solver classes*. That is, the solver code consisted entirely of specifying a class that inherited from both `PrefShock` and `KinkedR`.\n",
