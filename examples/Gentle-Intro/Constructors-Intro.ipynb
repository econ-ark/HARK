That's fine, and we do it too in our projects! The most common situation for this is when some model inputs have been pre-computed-- maybe in an earlier phase of this project, or maybe the results from someone else's project. This might be a life-cycle sequence of parameters estimated in reduced form, or transition probabilities among discrete states. In these situations, we recommend that your project have a `Parameters.py` file where you do the work of reading in this outside data and constructing the parameter dictionary you want to use."
