# The module `HARK.ConsumptionSaving.ConsIndShockModel` concerns consumption-saving models with idiosyncratic shocks to (non-capital) income.  All of the models assume CRRA utility with geometric discounting, no bequest motive, and income shocks are fully transitory or fully permanent.
#
# `ConsIndShockModel` currently includes three models:
# 1. A very basic "perfect foresight" model with no uncertainty.
# 2. A model with risk over transitory and permanent income shocks.
# 3. The model described in (2), with an interest rate for debt that differs from the interest rate for savings.
#
# This notebook provides documentation for the third of these models.

# ## Statement of "kinked R" model
#
# Consider a small extension to the model faced by `IndShockConsumerType`s: that the interest rate on borrowing $a_t < 0$ is greater than the interest rate on saving $a_t > 0$.  Consumers who face this kind of problem are represented by the $\texttt{KinkedRconsumerType}$ class.
#
# For a full theoretical treatment, this model analyzed in [A Theory of the Consumption Function, With
# and Without Liquidity Constraints](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/ATheoryv3JEP.pdf)
# and its [expanded edition](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/ATheoryv3NBER.pdf).
#
# Continuing to work with *normalized* variables (e.g. $m_t$ represents the level of market resources divided by permanent income), the "kinked R" model can be stated as:
#
# \begin{eqnarray*}
# v_t(m_t) &=& \max_{c_t} {~} U(c_t) + \DiscFac (1-\DiePrb_{t+1})  \mathbb{E}_{t} \left[ (\PermGroFac_{t+1}\psi_{t+1})^{1-\CRRA} v_{t+1}(m_{t+1}) \right], \\
# a_t &=& m_t - c_t, \\
# a_t &\geq& \underline{a}, \\
# m_{t+1} &=& \Rfree_t/(\PermGroFac_{t+1} \psi_{t+1}) a_t + \theta_{t+1}, \\
# \Rfree_t &=& \cases{\Rfree_{boro} \texttt{ if } a_t < 0 \\
#                     \Rfree_{save} \texttt{ if } a_t \geq 0},\\
# \Rfree_{boro} &>& \Rfree_{save}, \\
# (\psi_{t+1},\theta_{t+1}) &\sim& F_{t+1}, \\
# \mathbb{E}[\psi]=\mathbb{E}[\theta] &=& 1.
# \end{eqnarray*}

# ## Solving the "kinked R" model
#
# The solution method for the "kinked R" model is nearly identical to that of the `IndShockConsumerType` on which it is based, using the endogenous grid method; see the notebook for that model for more information.  The only significant difference is that the interest factor varies by $a_t$ across the exogenously chosen grid of end-of-period assets, with a discontinuity in $\Rfree$ at $a_t=0$.
#
# To correctly handle this, the `solveConsKinkedR` function inserts *two* instances of $a_t=0$ into the grid of $a_t$ values: the first corresponding to $\Rfree_{boro}$ ($a_t = -0$) and the other corresponding to $\Rfree_{save}$ ($a_t = +0$).  The two consumption levels (and corresponding endogenous $m_t$ gridpoints) represent points at which the agent's first order condition is satisfied at *exactly* $a_t=0$  at the two different interest factors.  In between these two points, the first order condition *does not hold with equality*: the consumer will end the period with exactly $a_t=0$, consuming $c_t=m_t$, but his marginal utility of consumption exceeds the marginal value of saving and is less than the marginal value of borrowing.  This generates a consumption function with *two* kinks: two concave portions (for borrowing and saving) with a linear segment of slope 1 in between.

# ## Example parameter values to construct an instance of KinkedRconsumerType
#
# The parameters required to create an instance of `KinkedRconsumerType` are nearly identical to those for `IndShockConsumerType`.  The only difference is that the parameter $\texttt{Rfree}$ is replaced with $\texttt{Rboro}$ and $\texttt{Rsave}$.
#
# While the parameter $\texttt{CubicBool}$ is required to create a valid `KinkedRconsumerType` instance, it must be set to `False`; cubic spline interpolation has not yet been implemented for this model.  In the future, this restriction will be lifted.

# These example parameters are almost identical to those used for `IndShockExample` in the prior notebook, except that the interest rate on borrowing is 20% (like a credit card), and the interest rate on saving is 1%.

# The cell below creates an infinite horizon instance of `KinkedRconsumerType` and solves its model by calling its `solve` method.

# %%
KinkyExample = KinkedRconsumerType(**KinkedRdict)
KinkyExample.cycles = 0  # Make the example infinite horizon
KinkyExample.solve()

# %% [markdown]
# An element of a `KinkedRconsumerType`'s solution will have all the same attributes as that of a `IndShockConsumerType`; see that notebook for details.
#
# We can plot the consumption function of our "kinked R" example, as well as the MPC:

# %%
print("Kinked R consumption function:")
plot_funcs(KinkyExample.solution[0].cFunc, KinkyExample.solution[0].mNrmMin, 5)

print("Kinked R marginal propensity to consume:")

# ## Simulating the "kinked R" model
#
# In order to generate simulated data, an instance of `KinkedRconsumerType` needs to know how many agents there are that share these particular parameters (and are thus *ex ante* homogeneous), the distribution of states for newly "born" agents, and how many periods to simulated.  These simulation parameters are described in the table below, along with example values.
#
# | Description | Code | Example value |
# | :---: | --- | --- |
# | Number of consumers of this type | $\texttt{AgentCount}$ | $10000$ |
# | Number of periods to simulate | $\texttt{T_sim}$ | $500$ |
# | Mean of initial log (normalized) assets | $\texttt{aNrmInitMean}$ | $-6.0$ |
# | Stdev of initial log  (normalized) assets | $\texttt{aNrmInitStd}$ | $1.0$ |
# | Mean of initial log permanent income | $\texttt{pLvlInitMean}$ | $0.0$ |
# | Stdev of initial log permanent income | $\texttt{pLvlInitStd}$ | $0.0$ |
# | Aggregrate productivity growth factor | $\texttt{PermGroFacAgg}$ | $1.0$ |
# | Age after which consumers are automatically killed | $\texttt{T_age}$ | $None$ |
#
# Here, we will simulate 10,000 consumers for 500 periods.  All newly born agents will start with permanent income of exactly $P_t = 1.0 = \exp(\texttt{pLvlInitMean})$, as $\texttt{pLvlInitStd}$ has been set to zero; they will have essentially zero assets at birth, as $\texttt{aNrmInitMean}$ is $-6.0$; assets will be less than $1\%$ of permanent income at birth.
#
# These example parameter values were already passed as part of the parameter dictionary that we used to create `KinkyExample`, so it is ready to simulate.  We need to set the `track_vars` attribute to indicate the variables for which we want to record a *history*.

# %%
KinkyExample.track_vars = ["mNrm", "cNrm", "pLvl"]
KinkyExample.initialize_sim()
KinkyExample.simulate()

# %% [markdown]
# We can plot the average (normalized) market resources in each simulated period:

# %%
plt.plot(np.mean(KinkyExample.history["mNrm"], axis=1))
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Mean market resources")
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# Now let's plot the distribution of (normalized) assets $a_t$ for the current population, after simulating for $500$ periods; this should be fairly close to the long run distribution:

# %%
plt.plot(
    np.sort(KinkyExample.state_now["aNrm"]),
    np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, KinkyExample.AgentCount),
)
plt.xlabel("End-of-period assets")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative distribution")
plt.ylim(-0.01, 1.01)
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# We can see there's a significant point mass of consumers with *exactly* $a_t=0$; these are consumers who do not find it worthwhile to give up a bit of consumption to begin saving (because $\Rfree_{save}$ is too low), and also are not willing to finance additional consumption by borrowing (because $\Rfree_{boro}$ is too high).
#
# The smaller point masses in this distribution are due to $\texttt{HARK}$ drawing simulated income shocks from the discretized distribution, rather than the "true" lognormal distributions of shocks.  For consumers who ended $t-1$ with $a_{t-1}=0$ in assets, there are only 8 values the transitory shock $\theta_{t}$ can take on, and thus only 8 values of $m_t$ thus $a_t$ they can achieve; the value of $\psi_t$ is immaterial to $m_t$ when $a_{t-1}=0$.  You can verify this by changing $\texttt{TranShkCount}$ to some higher value, like 25, in the dictionary above, then running the subsequent cells; the smaller point masses will not be visible to the naked eye.
