    "In order to generate simulated data, an instance of $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ needs to know how many agents there are that share these particular parameters (and are thus *ex ante* homogeneous), the distribution of states for newly \"born\" agents, and how many periods to simulated.  These simulation parameters are described in the table below, along with example values.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Description | Code | Example value |\n",
    "| :---: | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Number of consumers of this type | $\\texttt{AgentCount}$ | $10000$ |\n",

    "| Mean of initial log (normalized) assets | $\\texttt{aNrmInitMean}$ | $-6.0$ |\n",

    "Here, we will simulate 10,000 consumers for 120 periods.  All newly born agents will start with permanent income of exactly $P_t = 1.0 = \\exp(\\texttt{pLvlInitMean})$, as $\\texttt{pLvlInitStd}$ has been set to zero; they will have essentially zero assets at birth, as $\\texttt{aNrmInitMean}$ is $-6.0$; assets will be less than $1\\%$ of permanent income at birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "These example parameter values were already passed as part of the parameter dictionary that we used to create $\\texttt{IndShockExample}$, so it is ready to simulate.  We need to set the $\\texttt{track_vars}$ attribute to indicate the variables for which we want to record a *history*."
