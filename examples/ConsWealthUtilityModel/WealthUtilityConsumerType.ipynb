    "The typical consumption-saving model assumes that agents derive a flow of utility from consumption each period, with additively separable utility across time. In `HARK.ConsumptionSaving.ConsWealthUtility` module, we change this assumption to allow wealth (end-of-period assets) to enter the agent's utility function directly.\n",
