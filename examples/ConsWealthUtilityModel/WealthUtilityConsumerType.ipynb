    "# Wealth-in-Utility Multiplicatively with Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical consumption-saving model assumes that agents derive a flow of utility from consumption each period, with additively separable utility across time. In `HARK.ConsumptionSaving.ConsWealthUtility` module, we change this assumption to allow wealth (end-of-period assets) to enter the agent's utility function directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook concerns agents whose direct preferences for wealth are represented *multiplicatively* with consumption under a Cobb-Douglas aggregator. For *additive* direct preferences for wealth, see [the notebook for `CapitalistSpiritConsumerType`](./CapitalistSpiritConsumerType.ipynb) in the same module."

    "This model is identical to that of an `IndShockConsumerType` but for the presence of the Cobb-Douglas combination of assets and consumption to yield \"effective consumption\" $x_t$. As such, this model degenerates to `IndShockConsumerType` as $\\WealthShare \\rightarrow 0$.\n",

The model can still be solved when `WealthShift` is not zero, but the parameter will not control the extent to which wealth accumulation is a luxury good *in levels*.\n",
