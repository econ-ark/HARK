        Indicates whether to use transitory and permanent income shock
        volatilities from Sabelhaus & Song (2010) "The Great Moderation in
        Micro Labor Earnings". The default is False.
    adjust_infl_to : int, optional

    income_params : dict
        Dictionary with entries:
            - P0: initial level of permanent income.
            - pLvlInitMean: mean of the distribution of log-permanent income.
                np.log(P0) = pLvlInitMean
            - PermGroFac : list of deterministic growth factors for permanent
                income.
            - PermShkStd: list of standard deviations of shocks to
                log-permanent income.
            - TranShkStd: list of standard deviations of transitory shocks
                to income.
            - PermGroFacAgg: if a yearly trend in income is provided, this will
                be the aggregate level of growth in permanent incomes.

        This dictionary has the names and formats that various models in HARK
        expect, so that it can be directly updated into other parameter
        dictionaries.

# - He uses volatilities from Carroll-Samwick (1997)
# - He expresses income in dollars. It is more amicable to express it in
#   thousands of dollars, also making it comparable to CGM. Thus, we substract
#   ln(1e3) = 3*ln(10) from intercepts, which is equivalent to dividing income
#   by a thousand.
