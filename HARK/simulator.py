        User specifies how the grids of pre-states should be built. Output is

            nomial order. They are equispaced if a min and max are specified, and
            polynomially spaced with the specified order > 0 if provided. Otherwise,
            they are set at 0,..,N if only N is provided.
        twist : dict or None
            Mapping from end-of-period (continuation) variables to successor's
            arrival variables. When this is specified, additional output is created
            for the "full period" arrival-to-arrival transition matrix.
        norm : str or None
            Name of the shock variable by which to normalize for Harmenberg

        Maximum number of periods that will be simulated, determining the size
        of the history arrays.
    T_age: int
        Period after which to automatically terminate an agent if they would
        survive past this period.
    stop_dead : bool
        Whether simulated agents who draw dead=True should actually cease acting.
        Default is True. Setting to False allows "cohort-style" simulation that
        will generate many agents that survive to old ages. In most cases, T_sim
        should not exceed T_age, unless the user really does want multiple succ-
        essive cohorts to be born and fully simulated.
    replace_dead : bool
        Whether simulated agents who are marked as dead should be replaced with
        newborns (default True) or simply cease acting without replacement (False).
        The latter option is useful for models with state-dependent mortality,
        to allow "cohort-style" simulation with the correct distribution of states
        for survivors at each age. Setting to False has no effect if stop_dead is True.
    periods: list[SimBlock]
        Ordered list of simulation blocks, each representing a period.
    twist : dict
        Dictionary that maps period t-1 variables to period t variables, as a
        relabeling "between" periods.
    initializer : SimBlock
        A special simulated block that should have *no* arrival variables, because
        it represents the initialization of "newborn" agents.
    data : dict
        Dictionary that holds *current* values of model variables.
    track_vars : list[str]
        List of names of variables whose history should be tracked in the simulation.
    history : dict
        Dictionary that holds the histories of tracked variables.

        Build Markov-style transition matrices for each period of the model, as
        well as the initial distribution of arrival variables for newborns.
        Stores results to the attributes of self as follows:

        - trans_arrays : List of Markov matrices for transitioning from the arrival
                         state space in period t to the arrival state space in t+1.
                         This transition includes death (and replacement).
        - newborn_dstn : Stochastic vector as a NumPy array, representing the distribution
                         of arrival states for "newborns" who were just initialized.
        - state_grids : Nested list of tuples representing the arrival state space for
                        each period. Each element corresponds to the discretized arrival
                        state space point with the same index in trans_arrays (and
                        newborn_dstn). Arrival states are ordered within a tuple in the
                        same order as the model file. Linked from period[t].mesh.
        - outcome_arrays : List of dictionaries of arrays that cast from the arrival
                           state space to the grid of outcome variables, for each period.
                           Doing np.dot(state_dstn, outcome_arrays[t][var]) will yield
                           the discretized distribution of that outcome variable. Linked
                           from periods[t].matrices.
        - outcome_grids : List of dictionaries of discretized outcomes in each period.
                          Keys are names of outcome variables, and entries are vectors
                          of discretized values that the outcome variable can take on.
                          Doing np.dot(np.dot(state_dstn, outcome_arrays[var]), outcome_grids[var])
                          yields the *average* of that outcome in the population. Linked
                          from periods[t].grids.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_specs : dict
            Dictionary of dictionaries with specifications for discretized grids
            of all variables of interest. If any arrival variables are omitted,
            they will be given a default trivial grid with one node at 0. This
            should only be done if that arrival variable is closely tied to the
            Harmenberg normalizing variable; see below. A grid specification must
            include a number of gridpoints N, and should also include a min and
            max if the variable is continuous. If the variable is discrete, the
            grid values are assumed to be 0,..,N.
        norm : str or None
            Name of the variable for which Harmenberg normalization should be
            applied, if any. This should be a variable that is directly drawn
            from a distribution, not a "downstream" variable.
        fake_news_timing : bool
            Indicator for whether this call is part of the "fake news" algorithm
            for constructing sequence space Jacobians (SSJs). This should only
            ever be set to True in that situation, which affects how mortality
            is handled between periods. In short, the simulator usually assumes
            that "newborns" start with t_seq=0, but during the fake news algorithm,
            that is not the case.
        for_t : list or None
            Optional list of time indices for which the matrices should be built.
            When not specified, all periods are constructed. The most common use
            for this arg is during the "fake news" algorithm for lifecycle models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent : AgentType
        Agents for whom a new simulator is to be constructed.
    stop_dead : bool
        Whether simulated agents who draw dead=True should actually cease acting.
        Default is True. Setting to False allows "cohort-style" simulation that
        will generate many agents that survive to old ages. In most cases, T_sim
        should not exceed T_age, unless the user really does want multiple succ-
        essive cohorts to be born and fully simulated.
    replace_dead : bool
        Whether simulated agents who are marked as dead should be replaced with
        newborns (default True) or simply cease acting without replacement (False).
        The latter option is useful for models with state-dependent mortality,
