):
    """
    Reads (year,age)-specifc death probabilities form SSA life tables and
    transforms them to a list of survival probabilities in the format that
    HARK expects.

    Two methods are supported:
        - Cross-sectional: finds the 1-year survival probabilities for
          individuals in the age range for a fixed year.
          In the output,
          SurvPrb(age) = 1 - DeathPrb(age, year)

        - Longitudinal: finds the 1-year survival probabilities for individuals
          of a fixed cohort at different ages (and years).
          In the output,
          SurvPrb(age) = 1 - DeathPrb(age, cohort + age)

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_age : int
        Minimum age for survival probabilities.
    max_age : int
        Maximum age for survival probabilities.
    female : bool, optional
        Boolean indicating wether to use female or male survival probabilities.
        The default is True (female).
    cohort : int, optional
        If longitudinal probabilities are requested, this is the birth year of
        the cohort that will be tracked. The default is None.
    cross_sec : bool, optional
        Boolean indicating whether the cross-sectional method should be used.
        The default is False (using the longitudinal method).
    year : int, optional
        If cross-sectional probabilities are requestedm this is the year at
        which they will be taken. The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    LivPrb : [float]
        List of 1-year survival probabilities.
        LivPrb[n] corresponds to the probability that an indivivual of age
        'min_age' + n survives one year, in the year 'year' if the
        cross-sectional method is used or 'cohort' + ('min_age' + n) if the
        longitudinal method is used.
