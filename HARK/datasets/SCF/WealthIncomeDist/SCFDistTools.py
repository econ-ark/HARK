    A funtion to retreive SCF summary statistics regarding wealth and

    level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    age : int, optional
        Age for which to retreive summary statistics. The statistics are
        calculated using 5-year age bins. Therefore, for instance, Age = 23
        will return statistics computed on ages (20,25].
        The default is None. In such case, the function will return statistics
        for the group without any age filtration.
    education : str, optional
        Education level for which to retreive summary statistics. Must be one
        of 'NoHS' (no high-school or GED), 'HS' (high-school or GED), or
        'College'.
        The default is None. In such case, no education filtration is applied
        (all groups are pooled).
    wave : int, optional
        SCF wave to use for summary statistics. Must be one of 1995, 1998,
        2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019.
        The default is None. In such case, all waves are used.

        Dictionary with summary statistics for wealth and permanent income
        for the specified group. Its fields correspond to the columns of

    """
    Finds and formats parameters for the initial distributions of permanent
    income and normalized wealth from the SCF's summary statistics.

    Many of HARK's models (e.g. PerfForesightConsumerType.sim_birth(),
    GenIncProcessConsumerType.sim_birth()) assume the initial distribution
    of permanent income (pLvl) and normalized wealth (aNrm) are log-normal.
    They construct these distributions from their means and standard
    deviations, which are parameters to the models. This fuction assigns these
    parameters using summary statistics from the SCF.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_year : int
        Base year to use for nominal quantities.
    age : int, optional
        Age for which to retreive summary statistics. See
        parse_scf_distr_stats(). The default is None.
    education : str, optional
        Edcuational attainment level for which to retreive summary
        statistics. See parse_scf_distr_stats(). The default is None.
    wave : int, optional
        SCF wave to use for summary statistics. See parse_scf_distr_stats().
        The default is None.
