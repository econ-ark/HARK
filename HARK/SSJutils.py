    """
    Constructs one or more sequence space Jacobian (SSJ) matrices for specified
    outcomes over one shock variable. It is "basic" in the sense that it only
    works for "one period infinite horizon" models, as in the original SSJ paper.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent : AgentType
        Agent for which the SSJ(s) should be constructed. Must have T_cycle=1
        and cycles=0, or the function will throw an error. Must have a model
        file defined or this won't work at all.
    shock : str
        Name of the variable that Jacobians will be computed with respect to.
        It does not need to be a "shock" in a modeling sense, but it must be a
        single-valued parameter (possibly a singleton list) that can be changed.
    outcomes : str or [str]
        Names of outcome variables of interest; an SSJ matrix will be constructed
        for each variable named here. If a single string is passed, the output
        will be a single np.array. If a list of strings are passed, the output
        will be a list of SSJ matrices in the order specified here.
    grids : dict
        Dictionary of dictionaries with discretizing grid information. The grids
        should include all arrival variables other than those that are normalized
        out. They should also include all variables named in outcomes, except
        outcomes that are continuation variables that remap to arrival variables.
        Grid specification must include number of nodes N, should also include
        min and max if the variable is continuous.
    eps : float
        Amount by which to perturb the shock variable. The default is 1e-4.
    T_max : int
        Size of the SSJ matrices: the maximum number of periods to consider.
        The default is 300.
    norm : str or None
        Name of the model variable to normalize by for Harmenberg aggregation,
        if any. For many HARK models, this should be 'PermShk', which enables
        the grid over permanent income to be omitted as an explicit state.
    solved : bool
        Whether the agent's model has already been solved. If False (default),
        it will be solved as the very first step. Solving the agent's long run
        model before constructing SSJ matrices has the advantage of not needing
        to re-solve the long run model for each shock variable.
    construct : bool
        Whether the construct (update) method should be run after the shock is
        updated. The default is True, which is the "safe" option. If the shock
        variable is a parameter that enters the model only *directly*, rather
        than being used to build a more complex model input, then this can be
        set to False to save a (very) small amount of time during computation.
        If it is set to False improperly, the SSJs will be very wrong, potentially
        just zero everywhere.
    offset : bool
        Whether the shock variable is "offset in time" for the solver, with a
        default of False. This should be set to True if the named shock variable
        (or the constructed model input that it affects) is indexed by t+1 from
        the perspective of the solver. For example, the period t solver for the
        ConsIndShock model takes in risk free interest factor Rfree as an argument,
        but it represents the value of R that will occur at the start of t+1.
    verbose : bool
        Whether to display timing/progress to screen. The default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    SSJ : np.array or [np.array]
        One or more sequence space Jacobian arrays over the outcome variables
        with respect to the named shock variable.

    Compute an AgentType instance's timepath of outcome responses to learning at

    the fake news algorithm. This function can be used to verify and/or debug the
    output of the fake news SSJ algorithm.

    Important: Mortality (or death and replacement generally) should be turned
    off in the model (via parameter values) for this to work properly. Or does it?

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent : AgentType
        Agent for which the response(s) should be calculated. Must have T_cycle=1
        and cycles=0, or the function will throw an error. Must have a model
        file defined or this won't work at all.
    shock : str
        Name of the variable that the response will be computed with respect to.
        It does not need to be a "shock" in a modeling sense, but it must be a
        single-valued parameter (possibly a singleton list) that can be changed.
    outcomes : str or [str]
        Names of outcome variables of interest; an SSJ matrix will be constructed
        for each variable named here. If a single string is passed, the output
        will be a single np.array. If a list of strings are passed, the output
        will be a list of dYdX vectors in the order specified here.
    grids : dict
        Dictionary of dictionaries with discretizing grid information. The grids
        should include all arrival variables other than those that are normalized
        out. They should also include all variables named in outcomes, except
        outcomes that are continuation variables that remap to arrival variables.
        Grid specification must include number of nodes N, should also include
        min and max if the variable is continuous.
    s : int
        Period in which the shock variable is perturbed, relative to current t=0.
        The default is 0.
    eps : float
        Amount by which to perturb the shock variable. The default is 1e-4.
    T_max : int
        The length of the simulation for this exercise. The default is 300.
    norm : str or None
        Name of the model variable to normalize by for Harmenberg aggregation,
        if any. For many HARK models, this should be 'PermShk', which enables
        the grid over permanent income to be omitted as an explicit state.
    solved : bool
        Whether the agent's model has already been solved. If False (default),
        it will be solved as the very first step.
    construct : [str]
        List of constructed objects that will be changed by perturbing shock.
        These should all share an "offset status" (True or False). Default is [].
    offset : bool
        Whether the shock variable is "offset in time" for the solver, with a
        default of False. This should be set to True if the named shock variable
        (or the constructed model input that it affects) is indexed by t+1 from
        the perspective of the solver. For example, the period t solver for the
        ConsIndShock model takes in risk free interest factor Rfree as an argument,
        but it represents the value of R that will occur at the start of t+1.
    verbose : bool
        Whether to display timing/progress to screen. The default is False.

    Returns
