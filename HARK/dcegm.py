    """
    Find index vectors `rise` and `fall` such that `rise` holds the indeces `i`
    such that x[i+1]>x[i] and `fall` holds indeces `j` such that either
    - x[j+1] < x[j] or,
    - x[j]>x[j-1] and v[j]<v[j-1].

    The vectors are essential to the DCEGM algorithm, as they definite the
    relevant intervals to be used to construct the upper envelope of potential
    solutions to the (necessary) first order conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        array of points where `v` is evaluated
