'''
High-level functions and classes for solving a wide variety of economic models.
The "core" of HARK is a framework for "microeconomic" and "macroeconomic"
models.  A micro model concerns the dynamic optimization problem for some type
of agents, where agents take the inputs to their problem as exogenous.  A macro
model adds an additional layer, endogenizing some of the inputs to the micro
problem by finding a general equilibrium dynamic rule.

        Initialize an instance of AgentType by setting attributes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        solution_terminal : Solution
            A representation of the solution to the terminal period problem of
            this AgentType instance, or an initial guess of the solution if this
            is an infinite horizon problem.
        cycles : int
            The number of times the sequence of periods is experienced by this
            AgentType in their "lifetime".  cycles=1 corresponds to a lifecycle
            model, with a certain sequence of one period problems experienced
            once before terminating.  cycles=0 corresponds to an infinite horizon
            model, with a sequence of one period problems repeating indefinitely.
        time_flow : boolean
            Whether time is currently "flowing" forward(True) or backward(False) for this

            and simulating (etc).
        pseudo_terminal : boolean
            Indicates whether solution_terminal isn't actually part of the
            solution to the problem (as a known solution to the terminal period
            problem), but instead represents a "scrap value"-style termination.
            When True, solution_terminal is not included in the solution; when
            false, solution_terminal is the last element of the solution.
        tolerance : float
            Maximum acceptable "distance" between successive solutions to the
            one period problem in an infinite horizon (cycles=0) model in order
            for the solution to be considered as having "converged".  Inoperative

    This function contains simple code to copy a submodule to a location on

    the Econ-ARK package structure, for purposes of tinkering and experimenting
    directly. This is meant to be a simple way to explore HARK code. To interact
    with the codebase under active development, please refer to the documentation

        from HARK.core import copy_module_to_local
        copy_module_to_local("FULL-HARK-MODULE-NAME-HERE")

    For example, if you want SolvingMicroDSOPs you would enter

        copy_module_to_local("HARK.SolvingMicroDSOPs")
