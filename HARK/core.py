'''
High-level functions and classes for solving a wide variety of economic models.
The "core" of HARK is a framework for "microeconomic" and "macroeconomic"
models.  A micro model concerns the dynamic optimization problem for some type
of agents, where agents take the inputs to their problem as exogenous.  A macro
model adds an additional layer, endogenizing some of the inputs to the micro
problem by finding a general equilibrium dynamic rule.
