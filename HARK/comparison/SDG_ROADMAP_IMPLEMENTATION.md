# HARK SDG Roadmap Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of missing pieces from the HARK SDG roadmap for comparing traditional dynamic programming methods against cutting-edge deep learning algorithms for high-dimensional heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models.

## 🎯 Roadmap Vision

**Goal**: Enable comparison between traditional HARK methods and cutting-edge deep learning algorithms (e.g., Maliar, Maliar & Winant 2021) for solving high-dimensional heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models like Krusell-Smith and Aiyagari.

## ✅ Implemented Components

### 1. Problem Representation (Block Models)

**Files Created:**
- `HARK/comparison/models/krusell_smith_blocks.py`

  - Calibrated to standard literature values

- **Aiyagari Model**: Block-based representation with idiosyncratic risk
  - Individual consumption-saving block with income shocks
  - Aggregate equilibrium block with firm optimization
  - Employment and income process calibration
  - Market clearing conditions

**Key Features:**
- Modular block structure (DBlock, RBlock)
- Proper shock processes (MarkovProcess, Lognormal)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Block Model Usage
```python
from HARK.comparison.models.krusell_smith_blocks import simple_krusell_smith_model, ks_calibration

# Initialize model with calibration
model = simple_krusell_smith_model
model.construct_shocks(ks_calibration)

# Access model components
print(f"Blocks: {[b.name for b in model.blocks]}")
print(f"Variables: {model.get_vars()}")
```

### Baseline Workflow
```python
from HARK.comparison.base import ModelComparison

comparison = ModelComparison()

# Save expensive traditional solution as baseline
comparison.save_baseline_solution(
    method="traditional_hark",
    filepath="ks_baseline.pkl",
    include_adapter=True
)

# Load and compare multiple methods against baseline
comparison.load_baseline_solution("ks_baseline.pkl", "hark_benchmark")

results = comparison.compare_against_baseline(
    baseline_name="hark_benchmark",
    methods=["neural_network", "maliar_external"],
    metrics_to_compare=["speed", "accuracy", "welfare"]
)
```

### Method Comparison
```python
# Traditional HARK method
traditional_solution = solve_with_hark(krusell_smith_model)

# Cutting-edge deep learning method
modern_solution = solve_with_neural_network(krusell_smith_model)

# Compare performance
comparison_results = compare_solutions(traditional_solution, modern_solution)
print(f"Speed improvement: {comparison_results['speed_ratio']:.2f}x")
print(f"Accuracy difference: {comparison_results['accuracy_diff']:.4f}")
```
