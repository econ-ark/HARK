Instructions on modifying the mortality assumptions used in Section 5 of Carroll et al. (2017)

The default data used in the life cycle specifications in Carroll et al. (2017) are US 2010 actuarial life table data from the Social Security Administration.

To run the model using alternative data (from other years or other countries), users can name the alternative data file "alternativedata.txt", and save this in the "home/users/Documents/" folder. 
The data format that the code expects is: tab-delimited text, death probabilities in columns 1 and 4 for male and female, numbers of survivors in columns 2 and 5 for male and female, and life expectancies in columns 3 and 6. The age starts at 0 and ends at 119.
