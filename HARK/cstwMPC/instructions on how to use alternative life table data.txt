The default data used in the life cycle specifications in Carroll et al. (2017) are US 2010 actuarial life table data from the Social Security Administration.

To run the model using alternative data (from other years or other countries), users can name the alternative data file "alternativedata.txt", and save this in the "home/users/Downloads/" folder.

Actuarial life tables for Japan are provided in the same folder as this file's location as an example.
