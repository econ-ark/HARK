name: ConsMarkov
description: >-
  Consumption-saving model with permanent and transitory income shocks, as well
  as a discrete state that evolves according to a Markov matrix. Mortality, income
  risk, income growth, and the asset return factor can all depend on the discrete
  state. Asset returns are risk-free within a discrete state.

initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution

  Mrkv ~ {MrkvArray}(zPrev)            \\ current discrete state depends on prior state
  z = Mrkv                             \\ duplicate label of discrete state for easy typing
  (PermShk, TranShk) ~ IncShkDstn[z]   \\ draw permanent and transitory income shocks
  yNrm = TranShk                       \\ normalized income is the transitory shock
  G    = PermGroFac[z] * PermShk       \\ calculate permanent income growth
  pLvl = pLvlPrev * G                  \\ update permanent income level
  bNrm = Rfree[z] * kNrm / G           \\ calculate normalized bank balances
  mNrm = bNrm + yNrm                   \\ calculate normalized market resources
  cNrm = cFuncX@(z, mNrm)              \\ evaluate consumption from discrete state and market resources
  aNrm = mNrm - cNrm                   \\ calculate normalized end-of-period assets
  LivPrb_i = LivPrb[z]                 \\ get state-conditional survival probability
  live ~ {LivPrb_i}                    \\ draw survival
  dead = 1 - live                      \\ decedents are non-survivors
