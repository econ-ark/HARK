description: >-
  Consumption-saving model with permanent and transitory income risk and asset
  allocation between a risk-free asset and a (higher return) risky asset. In
  this simple model, asset returns happen at the *end* of a period. This will
  only work properly if income and return shocks are independent.

  variables:
    - kNrm!              \\ beginning of period wealth, normalized by p_{t-1}
    - pLvlPrev!          \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - Risky              \\ realized return factor on risky assets
    - Rport              \\ realized return factor on portfolio
    - yNrm               \\ normalized labor income
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level

    - mNrm               \\ normalized market resources
    - cNrm               \\ normalized consumption
    - Share              \\ share of wealth allocated to risky assets this period
    - aNrm               \\ normalized end-of-period assets
    - qNrm               \\ normalized risky asset holdings
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rfree              \\ risk free return factor on assets
    - PermGroFac+        \\ expected permanent income growth factor
    - LivPrb             \\ survival probability at end of period
  functions:
    - cFunc*             \\ consumption function over market resources
    - ShareFunc*         \\ risky share function over market resource
  distributions:
    - IncShkDstn+        \\ joint distribution of permanent and transitory income shocks
    - RiskyDstn          \\ distribution of risky asset returns
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution
dynamics: |
  (PermShk, TranShk) ~ IncShkDstn           \\ draw income shocks from joint distribution
  yNrm   = TranShk                          \\ normalized income is the transitory shock
  G      = PermGroFac * PermShk             \\ calculate permanent income growth
  pLvl   = pLvlPrev * G                     \\ update permanent income level
  bNrm   = kNrm / G                         \\ calculate normalized bank balances
  mNrm   = bNrm + yNrm                      \\ calculate normalized market resources
  cNrm   = cFunc@(mNrm)                     \\ evaluate consumption when share is fixed
  Share  = ShareFunc@(mNrm)                 \\ evaluate risky share when it is fixed
  wNrm   = mNrm - cNrm                      \\ calculate wealth after consumption
  Risky  ~ RiskyDstn                        \\ draw risky return shock
  Rport  = Rfree + (Risky-Rfree)*Share      \\ calculate realized portfolio return
  aNrm   = Rport * wNrm                     \\ calculate end-of-period assets
  qNrm   = aNrm * Share                     \\ calculate risky asset holdings
  live   ~ {LivPrb}                         \\ draw survival
  dead   = 1 - live                         \\ dead are non-survivors
