  Consumption-saving-labor supply model with permanent and transitory productivity
  shocks and a risk-free asset. Labor supply choice is made on the intensive margin.

  variables:
    - kNrm!              \\ beginning of period capital, normalized by p_{t-1}
    - pLvlPrev!          \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - yNrm               \\ normalized labor income
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level
    - bNrm               \\ normalized bank balances
    - mNrm               \\ normalized market resources
    - cNrm               \\ normalized consumption
    - Lbr                \\ quantity of labor supplied, on unit interval
    - Lsr                \\ quantity of leisure, additive complement of Lbr
    - aNrm               \\ normalized end-of-period assets
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rfree+             \\ risk free return factor on assets
    - PermGroFac+        \\ expected permanent income growth factor
    - LivPrb             \\ survival probability at end of period
    - WageRte            \\ wage rate this period
  functions:
    - cFunc*             \\ consumption function over bank balances and transitory productivity shock
    - LbrFunc*           \\ labor supply function over bank balances and transitory productivity shock
  distributions:
    - IncShkDstn+        \\ joint distribution of permanent and transitory productivity shocks
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution
dynamics: |
  (PermShk, TranShk) ~ IncShkDstn  \\ draw permanent and transitory income shocks
  G    = PermGroFac * PermShk      \\ calculate permanent income growth
  pLvl = pLvlPrev * G              \\ update permanent income level
  bNrm = Rfree * kNrm / G          \\ calculate normalized bank balances
  Lbr  = LbrFunc@(bNrm, TranShk)   \\ evaluate labor supply from bank balances and transitory productivity
  Lsr  = 1.0 - Lbr                 \\ leisure is the additive complement of labor
  cNrm = cFunc@(bNrm, TranShk)     \\ evaluate consumption from bank balances and transitory productivity
  LbrEff = TranShk*Lbr             \\ calculate effectively supplied labor
  yNrm = WageRte*LbrEff            \\ normalized income is wage rate times effective labor
  mNrm = bNrm + yNrm               \\ calculate normalized market resources
  aNrm = mNrm - cNrm               \\ calculate normalized end-of-period assets
  live ~ {LivPrb}                  \\ draw survival
  dead = 1 - live                  \\ dead are non-survivors
