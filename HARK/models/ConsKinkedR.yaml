description: >-
  Consumption-saving model with permanent and transitory income shocks and a
  risk-free asset with higher interest rate for borrowing than saving.

  variables:
    - kNrm               \\ beginning of period capital, normalized by p_{t-1}
    - pLvlPrev           \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - yNrm               \\ normalized labor income
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level
    - bNrm               \\ normalized bank balances
    - mNrm               \\ normalized market resources
    - cNrm               \\ normalized consumption
    - aNrm               \\ normalized end-of-period assets
    - Rfree              \\ realized interest factor, depending on save/borrow
    - boro (bool)        \\ indicator for whether agent is borrowing
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rboro              \\ risk free interest factor when borrowing
    - Rsave              \\ risk free interest factor when saving
    - PermGroFac         \\ expected permanent income growth factor
    - LivPrb             \\ survival probability at end of period
  functions:
    - cFunc              \\ consumption function over market resources
  distributions:
    - IncShkDstn         \\ joint distribution of permanent and transitory shocks
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
  arrival: [kNrm, pLvlPrev]
  solution: [cFunc]
  offset: [PermGroFac, Rboro, Rsave, IncShkDstn]
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution
dynamics: |
  (PermShk, TranShk) ~ IncShkDstn   \\ draw permanent and transitory income shocks
  yNrm = TranShk                    \\ normalized income is the transitory shock
  G    = PermGroFac * PermShk       \\ calculate permanent income growth
  pLvl = pLvlPrev * G               \\ update permanent income level
  boro = (kNrm < 0.0)               \\ whether agent is borrowing
  Rfree= Rsave + (Rboro-Rsave)*boro \\ realized interest factor depends on borrowing / saving
  bNrm = Rfree * kNrm / G           \\ calculate normalized bank balances
  mNrm = bNrm + yNrm                \\ calculate normalized market resources
  cNrm = cFunc@(mNrm)               \\ evaluate consumption from market resources
  aNrm = mNrm - cNrm                \\ calculate normalized end-of-period assets
  live ~ {LivPrb}                   \\ draw survivors
  dead = 1 - live                   \\ dead are non-survivors
