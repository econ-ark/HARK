name: ConsPortfolio
description: >-
  Consumption-saving model with permanent and transitory income risk and asset
  allocation between a risk-free asset and a (higher return) risky asset. The
  agent might only be able to update their portfolio shares some of the time.

  variables:
    - kNrm!              \\ beginning of period wealth, normalized by p_{t-1}
    - pLvlPrev!          \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - SharePrev!         \\ share of wealth held in risky assets at period start
    - Risky              \\ realized return factor on risky assets
    - Rport              \\ realized return factor on portfolio
    - Adjust (bool)      \\ whether the agent can adjust their portfolio this period
    - yNrm               \\ normalized labor income
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level
    - bNrm               \\ normalized bank balances
    - mNrm               \\ normalized market resources
    - cNrm               \\ normalized consumption
    - Share              \\ share of wealth allocated to risky assets this period
    - aNrm               \\ normalized end-of-period assets
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rfree+             \\ risk free return factor on assets
    - PermGroFac+        \\ expected permanent income growth factor
    - LivPrb             \\ survival probability at end of period
    - AdjustPrb          \\ probability of being able to adjust risky asset share
  functions:
    - cFuncFxd*          \\ consumption function over market resources and risky share when share is fixed
    - cFuncAdj*          \\ consumption function over market resources when share is adjusted
    - ShareFuncAdj*      \\ risky share function over market resources (when possible to adjust)
    - ShareFuncFxd*      \\ risky share function over market resources when it is fixed
  distributions:
    - ShockDstn+         \\ joint distribution of permanent, transitory, and return shocks
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution
  SharePrev = 0.                            \\ set initial risky asset share to zero
dynamics: |
  (PermShk, TranShk, Risky) ~ ShockDstn     \\ draw shocks from joint distribution
  yNrm   = TranShk                          \\ normalized income is the transitory shock
  G      = PermGroFac * PermShk             \\ calculate permanent income growth
  pLvl   = pLvlPrev * G                     \\ update permanent income level
  Rport  = Rfree + (Risky-Rfree)*SharePrev  \\ calculate realized portfolio return
  bNrm   = Rport * kNrm / G                 \\ calculate normalized bank balances
  mNrm   = bNrm + yNrm                      \\ calculate normalized market resources
  cNrmF  = cFuncFxd@(mNrm, SharePrev)       \\ evaluate consumption when share is fixed
  ShareF = ShareFuncFxd@(mNrm, SharePrev)   \\ evaluate risky share when it is fixed
  cNrmA  = cFuncAdj@(mNrm)                  \\ evaluate consumption when share is adjustable
  ShareA = ShareFuncAdj@(mNrm)              \\ evaluate risky share when it is adjustable
  Adjust ~ {AdjustPrb}                      \\ determine whether agent can actually adjust
  cNrm   = Adjust*cNrmA + (1-Adjust)*cNrmF  \\ select actual consumption based on adjustment
  Share  = Adjust*ShareA + (1-Adjust)*ShareF\\ select risky asset share based on adjustment
  aNrm   = mNrm - cNrm                      \\ calculate normalized end-of-period assets
  live   ~ {LivPrb}                         \\ draw survival
  dead   = 1 - live                         \\ dead are non-survivors
