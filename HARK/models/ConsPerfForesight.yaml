  mortality risk.

  variables:
    - kNrm               \\ beginning of period capital, normalized by p_{t-1}
    - pLvlPrev           \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - yNrm               \\ normalized labor income, always one
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level
    - bNrm               \\ normalized bank balances
    - mNrm               \\ normalized market resources
    - cNrm               \\ normalized consumption
    - aNrm               \\ normalized end-of-period assets
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rfree              \\ risk free return factor on assets
    - PermGroFac         \\ expected permanent income growth factor
    - LivPrb             \\ survival probability at end of period
  functions:
    - cFunc              \\ consumption function over market resources
  distributions:
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
  arrival: [kNrm, pLvlPrev]
  solution: [cFunc]
  offset: [PermGroFac]
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution
dynamics: |
  yNrm = 1.0                       \\ normalized income is constant in PF setting
  pLvl = pLvlPrev * PermGroFac     \\ update permanent income level
  bNrm = Rfree * kNrm / PermGroFac \\ calculate normalized bank balances
  mNrm = bNrm + yNrm               \\ calculate normalized market resources
  cNrm = cFunc@(mNrm)              \\ evaluate consumption from market resources
  aNrm = mNrm - cNrm               \\ calculate normalized end-of-period assets
  live ~ {LivPrb}                  \\ draw survivors
  dead = 1 - live                  \\ dead are non-survivors
twist:
  aNrm: kNrm
  pLvl: pLvlPrev
