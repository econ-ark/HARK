name: ConsMedShock
description: >-
  Consumption-saving model with permanent and transitory income shocks as well
  as a second consumption good with stochastic marginal utility, representing
  medical care; agent can save in a single risk-free asset.

  variables:
    - kLvl!              \\ beginning of period capital
    - pLvlPrev!          \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - yLvl               \\ labor income level
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level
    - bLvl               \\ bank balances level
    - MedShk             \\ medical needs shock as marginal utility factor
    - mLvl               \\ market resources level
    - cLvl               \\ consumption level
    - xLvl               \\ total expenditure level
    - MedLvl             \\ medical care level
    - aLvl               \\ end-of-period assets level
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rfree+             \\ risk free return factor on assets
    - LivPrb             \\ survival probability at end of period
    - MedPrice           \\ price of medical care relative to consumption
  functions:
    - policyFunc*        \\ consumption and medical spending function over market resources, permanent income, and medical need shock
    - pLvlNextFunc+      \\ expected permanent income as function of prior permanent income
  distributions:
    - IncShkDstn+        \\ joint distribution of permanent and transitory shocks
    - MedShkDstn         \\ distribution of marginal utility shocks
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial capital from distribution
  kLvl = pLvlPrev * kNrm           \\ de-normalize capital by permanent income
dynamics: |
  (PermShk, TranShk) ~ IncShkDstn  \\ draw permanent and transitory income shocks
  p_temp = pLvlNextFunc@(pLvlPrev) \\ find expected permanent income level, without shock
  pLvl = p_temp * PermShk          \\ update permanent income level with shock
  yLvl = TranShk * pLvl            \\ income is the transitory shock times permanent income
  bLvl = Rfree * kLvl              \\ calculate bank balances
  mLvl = bLvl + yLvl               \\ calculate market resources
  MedShk ~ MedShkDstn              \\ draw medical need shocks
  (cLvl,MedLvl) = policyFunc@(mLvl, pLvl, MedShk)  \\ evaluate policy function at state
  xLvl = cLvl + MedPrice*MedLvl    \\ calculate total expenditure
  aLvl = mLvl - xLvl               \\ calculate end-of-period assets
  live ~ {LivPrb}                  \\ draw survivors
  dead = 1 - live                  \\ dead are non-survivors
