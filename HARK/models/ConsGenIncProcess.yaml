description: >-
  Consumption-saving model with with transitory  and persistent income shocks;
  the persistent component of income evolves according to a general function.
  The agent can invest in a single risk-free asset.

  variables:
    - kLvl               \\ beginning of period capital
    - pLvlPrev           \\ inbound permanent income level, before growth
    - yLvl               \\ labor income level
    - pLvl               \\ permanent income level
    - bLvl               \\ bank balances level
    - mLvl               \\ market resources level
    - cLvl               \\ consumption level
    - aLvl               \\ end-of-period assets level
    - live (bool)        \\ whether the agent survives
  parameters:
    - Rfree              \\ risk free return factor on assets
    - LivPrb             \\ probability of dying at end of period
  functions:
    - cFunc              \\ consumption function over permanent income and market resources
    - pLvlNextFunc       \\ expected permanent income as function of prior permanent income
  distributions:
    - IncShkDstn         \\ joint distribution of permanent and transitory shocks
    - pLvlInitDstn       \\ distribution of permanent income at model birth
    - kNrmInitDstn       \\ distribution of normalized capital holdings at birth
  arrival: [kLvl, pLvlPrev]
  solution: [cFunc]
  offset: [pLvlNextFunc, Rfree, IncShkDstn]
initialize: |
  pLvlPrev ~ pLvlInitDstn          \\ draw initial permanent income from distribution
  kNrm ~ kNrmInitDstn              \\ draw initial normalized capital from distribution
  kLvl = pLvlPrev * kNrm           \\ de-normalize capital by permanent income
dynamics: |
  (PermShk, TranShk) ~ IncShkDstn  \\ draw permanent and transitory income shocks
  p_temp = pLvlNextFunc@(pLvlPrev) \\ find expected permanent income level, without shock
  pLvl = p_temp * PermShk          \\ update permanent income level with shock
  yLvl = TranShk * pLvl            \\ income is the transitory shock times permanent income
  bLvl = Rfree * kLvl              \\ calculate bank balances
  mLvl = bLvl + yLvl               \\ calculate market resources
  cLvl = cFunc@(mLvl, pLvl)        \\ evaluate consumption from market resources and permanent income
  aLvl = mLvl - cLvl               \\ calculate end-of-period assets
  live ~ {LivPrb}                  \\ draw survivors
  dead = 1 - live                  \\ dead are non-survivors
