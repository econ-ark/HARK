I. INTRODUCTION

Welcome to HARK!  We are tremendously excited you're here.  HARK is
very much a work in progress, but we hope you find it valuable.  We 
*really* hope you find it so valuable that you decide to contribute
to it yourself.  This document will tell you how to get HARK up and
running on your machine, and what you will find in HARK once you do.

If you have any comments on the code or documentation, we'd love to
hear from you!  Our email addresses are:

II. QUICK START GUIDE

This is going to be easy, friend.  HARK is written in Python, specifically the
Anaconda distribution of Python.  Follow these easy steps to get HARK going:

1) Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and download Anaconda for your
operating system; be sure to get the version for Python 2.7

2) Install Anaconda, using the instructions provided on that page.  Now you have
installed everything you need to run most of HARK.  But you still need to get HARK
on your machine.

3) To get HARK on your machine, you should know that HARK is managed with version 
control software called "Git".  HARK is hosted on a website called "GitHub" devoted
to hosting projects managed with Git.

If you don't want to know more than that, you don't have to.  Go to HARK's page
on GitHub, and then click the "Download ZIP" button in the upper right hand
corner of the page. Download the ZIP file and unzip it into an empty directory.
Maybe call that directory /HARK ?  The choice is yours.

You can also clone HARK off GitHub using Git.  This is slightly more difficult,
because it involves installing Git on your machine and learning a little about
how to use Git.  We believe this is an investment worth making, but it is up to you.
To learn more about Git, read the documentation at https://git-scm.com/documentation 
or visit many other great Git resources on the internet.

4) Open Spyder, an interactive development environment (IDE) for Python
(specifically, iPython).  On Windows, open a command prompt and type "spyder".
On Linux, open the command line and type "spyder".  On Mac, open the command
line and type "spyder".

5) Navigate to the directory where you put the HARK files.  This can be done
within Spyder by doing "import os" and then using os.chdir() to change directories.  
chdir works just like cd at a command prompt on most operating systems, except that
it takes a string as input: os.chdir('Music') moves to the Music subdirectory
of the current working directory.

6) Test one of HARK's sample modules with one of the following commands:

"run ConsumerExamples"
"run SolvingMicroDSOPs"
"run cstwMPC"
"run TBSexamples"

7) The Python environment can be cleared or reset with ctrl+.  Note that
this will also change the current working directory back to its default.
To change the default directory (the "global working directory"), see
Tools-->Preferences-->Global working directory; you might need to restart
Spyder for the change to take effect.

8) Read the more complete documentation in HARKdoc.pdf.

9) OPTIONAL: If you want to use HARK's multithreading capabilities, you will
need two Python packages that do not come automatically with Anaconda: joblib
and dill.  Assuming you have the necessary permissions on your machine, the 
easiest way to do this is through Anaconda.  Go to the command line, and type
"conda install joblib" and then "conda install dill".  If this doesn't work,
but you have Git, you can just clone the packages directly off GitHub.
Go to the command line and navigate to the directory you want to put these
packages in.  Then type "git clone https://github.com/joblib/joblib.git"
and then "git clone https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill".  Joblib should work
after this, but there is one more step to get dill working.  Navigate to dill's
directory in the command line, and then type "python setup.py build".  Then you
should have joblib and dill working on your machine.

Note: If you did not put joblib and dill in one of the paths in sys.path, you will
need to add the joblib and dill directories to sys.path.  The easiest way to do this
is to open up Anaconda, and type:

import sys
sys.path.append('path_to_joblib_directory')
sys.path.append('path_to_dill_directory')

IV. WARNINGS AND DISCLAIMERS

This is an early "alpha" version of HARK.  The code has not been
extensively tested as it should be.  We hope it is useful, but 
there are absolutely no guarantees (expressed or implied) that 
it works or will do what you want.  Use at your own risk.  And 
please, let us know if you find bugs!
