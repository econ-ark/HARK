 abstract = {The stochastic process for earnings is the key element of incomplete markets models in modern quantitative macroeconomics. We show that a simple modification of the canonical process used in the literature leads to a dramatic improvement in the measurement of earnings dynamics in administrative and survey data alike. Empirically, earnings at the start or end of earnings spells are lower and more volatile than the observations in the interior of earnings histories, reflecting the effects of working less than the full year as well as deviations of wages due to e.g. tenure effects. Ignoring these properties of earnings, as is standard in the literature, leads to a substantial mismeasurement of the variances of permanent and transitory shocks and induces the large and widely documented divergence in the estimates of these variances based on fitting the earnings moments in levels or growth rates. Accounting for these effects enables more accurate analysis using quantitative models with permanent and transitory earnings risk, and improves empirical estimates of consumption insurance against permanent earnings shocks.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to formally abstract a Markov process evolving over a general state space as a finite-state Markov chain, with the objective of precisely approximating the state probability distribution of the Markov process in time. The approach uses a partition of the state space and is based on the computation of the average transition probability between partition sets. In the case of unbounded state spaces, a procedure for precisely truncating the state space within a compact set is provided, together with an error bound that depends on the asymptotic properties of the transition kernel of the Markov process. In the case of compact state spaces, the work provides error bounds that depend on the diameters of the partitions, and as such the errors can be tuned. The method is applied to the problem of computing probabilistic invariance of the model under study, and the result is compared to an alternative approach in the literature.},

 abstract = {We propose a new classification of consumption goods into nondurable goods, durable goods and a new class which we call "memorable" goods. A good is memorable if a consumer can draw current utility from its past consumption experience through memory. We propose a novel consumption-savings model in which a consumer has a well-defined preference ordering over both nondurable goods and memorable goods. Memorable goods consumption differs from nondurable goods consumption in that current memorable goods consumption may also impact future utility through the accumulation process of the stock of memory. In our model, households optimally choose a lumpy profile of memorable goods consumption even in a frictionless world. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data, we then document levels and volatilities of different groups of consumption goods expenditures, as well as their expenditure patterns, and show that the expenditure patterns on memorable goods indeed differ significantly from those on nondurable and durable goods. Finally, we empirically evaluate our model's predictions with respect to the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations and conduct an excess-sensitivity test of the consumption response to predictable income changes. We find that (i) the welfare cost of household-level consumption fluctuations may be overstated by 1.7 percentage points (11.9\% points as opposed to 13.6\% points of permanent consumption) if memorable goods are not appropriately accounted for; (ii) the finding of excess sensitivity of consumption documented in important papers of the literature might be entirely due to the presence of memorable goods.},

  abstract =      {This paper presents a model in which price setting
                   firms decide what to pay attention to, subject to a
                   constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic
                   conditions are more variable or more important than
                   aggregate conditions, firms pay more attention to
                   idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate
                   conditions. When we calibrate the model to match the
                   large average absolute size of price changes observed
                   in micro data, prices react fast and by large amounts
                   to idiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small
                   amounts to nominal shocks. Nominal shocks have strong
                   and persistent real effects. (JEL D21, D83, E31,

                   according to which temporary real effects of purely
                   nominal disturbances result from imperfect
                   information, but departs from the assumptions of
                   Lucas (1973) in two crucial respects. Due to
                   monopolistically competitive pricing, higher-order
                   expectations are crucial for aggregate inflation
                   dynamics, as argued by Phelps (1983). And
                   decisionmakers' subjective perceptions of current
                   conditions are assumed to be of imperfect precision,
                   owing to finite information processing capacity, as
                   argued by Sims (2001). The model can explain highly
                   persistent real effects of a monetary disturbance,
                   and a delayed effect on inflation, as found in VAR

                   little or no liquid wealth (e.g. cash, checking, and
                   saving accounts), despite owning sizable amounts of
                   illiquid assets (i.e., assets that carry a
                   transaction cost, such as housing, large durables, or
                   retirement accounts). This portfolio configuration
                   implies that these households have large marginal
                   propensities to consume out of small income changes
                   â€“a key determinant of the macroeconomic
                   effects of fiscal policy. The wealthy hand-to-mouth,
                   therefore, behave in many respects like households
                   with little or no net worth, yet they escape standard
                   definitions (and empirical measurements) of
                   hand-to-mouth agents based on net worth. We use
                   survey data on household portfolios for the U.S.,
                   Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy,
                   and Spain to document the share of such households
                   across countries, their demographic characteristics,
                   the composition of their balance sheet, and the
                   persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life
                   cycle. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
                   group of consumers for macroeconomic modelling and
                   policy analysis.},

  abstract =      {This paper uses the information contained in the
                   joint dynamics of individuals' labor earnings and
                   consumption-choice decisions to quantify both the
                   amount of income risk that individuals face and the
                   extent to which they have access to informal
                   insurance against this risk. We accomplish this task
                   by using indirect inference to estimate a structural
                   consumption–savings model, in which individuals
                   both learn about the nature of their income process
                   and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In
                   this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial
                   insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences
                   in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with
                   which individuals know their own income growth rates
                   when they begin their working lives, (iv) the
                   persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the
                   tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the
                   amount of measurement error in the data. In
                   implementing indirect inference, we find that an
                   auxiliary model that approximates the true structural
                   equations of the model (which are not estimable)
                   works very well, with negligible small sample bias.
                   The main substantive findings are that income shocks
                   are moderately persistent, systematic differences in
                   income growth rates are large, individuals have
                   substantial amounts of information about their income
                   growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are
                   smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these
                   findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime
                   income risk that individuals perceive is
                   substantially smaller than what is typically assumed
                   in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete
                   markets.},

                   degree of autocorrelation, with a stickiness

                   The sticky consumption growth model outperforms the
                   random walk model of Hall (1978) and typically fits

But a large literature has found no evidence of habits in microeconomic datasets that measure the behavior of individual households. We show that the apparent conflict can be explained by a model in which consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal circumstances but ‘sticky expectations’ about the macroeconomy. In our model, the persistence of aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers’ imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility costs, because aggregate shocks constitute only a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.},

The model yields empirically realistic distributions of household wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two key features: multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and an idiosyncratic income process with leptokurtic income changes. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where intertemporal substitution drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption.},

                   little or no liquid wealth (e.g. cash, checking, and
                   saving accounts), despite owning sizable amounts of
                   illiquid assets (i.e., assets that carry a
                   transaction cost, such as housing, large durables, or
                   retirement accounts). This portfolio configuration
                   implies that these households have large marginal
                   propensities to consume out of small income changes
                   â€“a key determinant of the macroeconomic
                   effects of fiscal policy. The wealthy hand-to-mouth,
                   therefore, behave in many respects like households
                   with little or no net worth, yet they escape standard
                   definitions (and empirical measurements) of
                   hand-to-mouth agents based on net worth. We use
                   survey data on household portfolios for the U.S.,
                   Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy,
                   and Spain to document the share of such households
                   across countries, their demographic characteristics,
                   the composition of their balance sheet, and the
                   persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life
                   cycle. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
                   group of consumers for macroeconomic modelling and
                   policy analysis.},

abstract = { The paper develops a theory of exchange rate movements under perfect capital mobility, a slow adjustment of goods markets relative to asset markets, and consistent expectations. The perfect foresight path is derived and it is shown that along that along that path a monetary expansion causes the exchange rate to depreciate. An initial overshooting of exchange rates is shown to derive from differential adjustment speed of markets. The magnitude and persistence of the overshooting is developed in terms of the structural parameters of the model. To the extent that output responds to a monetary expansion in the short run, this acts a a dampening effect on exchange depreciation and may, in fact, lead to an increase in interest rates. }

                   firms decide what to pay attention to, subject to a
                   constraint on information flow. When idiosyncratic
                   conditions are more variable or more important than
                   aggregate conditions, firms pay more attention to
                   idiosyncratic conditions than to aggregate
                   conditions. When we calibrate the model to match the
                   large average absolute size of price changes observed
                   in micro data, prices react fast and by large amounts
                   to idiosyncratic shocks, but only slowly and by small
                   amounts to nominal shocks. Nominal shocks have strong
                   and persistent real effects. (JEL D21, D83, E31,

  abstract =      {This paper uses the information contained in the
                   joint dynamics of individuals' labor earnings and
                   consumption-choice decisions to quantify both the
                   amount of income risk that individuals face and the
                   extent to which they have access to informal
                   insurance against this risk. We accomplish this task
                   by using indirect inference to estimate a structural
                   consumption–savings model, in which individuals
                   both learn about the nature of their income process
                   and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In
                   this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial
                   insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences
                   in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with
                   which individuals know their own income growth rates
                   when they begin their working lives, (iv) the
                   persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the
                   tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the
                   amount of measurement error in the data. In
                   implementing indirect inference, we find that an
                   auxiliary model that approximates the true structural
                   equations of the model (which are not estimable)
                   works very well, with negligible small sample bias.
                   The main substantive findings are that income shocks
                   are moderately persistent, systematic differences in
                   income growth rates are large, individuals have
                   substantial amounts of information about their income
                   growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are
                   smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these
                   findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime
                   income risk that individuals perceive is
                   substantially smaller than what is typically assumed
                   in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete
                   markets.},

                   consistently and actively supported financial
                   deregulation. Given the low visibility and relatively
                   technical nature of the issues, presidents saw
                   deregulation as the best way to respond to technical
                   innovation in the industry and disruptions caused by
                   inflation. This history suggests several lessons for
                   students of the role of presidents in policy making.
                   Presidents can be active in promoting policy reform
                   even though standard methods for defining the
                   presidential agenda do not reveal this fact. We see
                   presidential engagement reflected in White House
                   statements both before and after legislation is
                   passed, and in White House use of study reports and
                   messages to shape an elite consensus.},

                   financial crisis on Canada's potential GDP growth.
                   Using a simple accounting framework to decompose
                   trend GDP growth into changes in capital, labor
                   services and total factor productivity, we find a
                   sizeable drop in Canadian potential growth in the
                   short term. The estimated decline of about 1
                   percentage point originates from a sharply
                   decelerating capital stock accumulation (as
                   investment has dropped steeply) and a rising
                   long-term unemployment rate (which would raise
                   equilibrium unemployment rates). However, over the
                   medium term, we expect Canada's potential GDP growth
                   to gradually rise to around 2 percent, below the
                   pre-crisis growth rate, mostly reflecting the effects
                   of population aging and a secular decline in average

The authors test for the restrictions and decompose moments of the asset returns into the contributions made by different factors. Their econometric methods take full account of time aggregation.},

These simulations for a typical annual post-World War II dataset illustrate how the estimated number of unit roots change in a nonmonotone fashion with the dimension of the system, and with the number of lags in the VAR representation. The authors find that overparametrization in high dimensions is as bad as underparametrization. The Bayes information criteria outperforms the Akaike information criteria in their setup.

We propose the following interpretation: borrowing and lending in response to changes in consumer demand are easier for individual U.S. states than for the United States as a whole, and therefore, the measured deviation from the benchmark permanent income hypothesis model is smaller. However, lagged state-specific variables help predict state-specific consumption, suggesting that the PIH model still requires qualification.},

We present a stylized theoretical model that illustrates why the appropriate method for deflating nominal GDP (for the purpose of measuring risk sharing) is with a CPI deflator, not with a GDP deflator. We further explain that CPI deflated GDP (the ``consumption value'' of output) and GDP deflated with a GDP deflator (the volume of output) do represent the same underlying economic series up to measurement error. We illustrate the results estimating the amount of risk shared within subgroups of U.S. states.},

We show how stochastic integral representations for the limiting distribution can be derived either from the local to unity approach with local drift and trend or from the continuous record asymptotic results of Sørensen [29]. We also show how the stochastic integral representations can be utilized as the basis for finding the corresponding characteristic functions via the Fredholm approach of Nabeya and Tanaka [16,17], This “link” between those two approaches may be of general interest. We further tabulate the asymptotic distribution by inverting the characteristic function. Using the same methods, we also find the characteristic function for the asymptotic distribution for the Schmidt-Phillips [26] unit root test. Our results show very clearly the dependence of the various tests on the initial value of the time series.},

The fifty U.S. states comprise an integrated capital market with very low barriers to capital flows, which makes them an ideal testing ground for neoclassical models. We develop a simple frictionless open economy model with perfectly diversified ownership of capital and find that capital flows among the states are consistent with the model. Therefore, the small size and \&quot;wrong\&quot; direction of net international capital flows are likely due to frictions associated with national borders, not to inherent flaws in the neoclassical model.

A calibrated model of endogenous homeownership and consumption is able to reproduce the patterns in the data quite well and provides an interpretation of the empirical results.},

The effect is particularly strong for whites from non-privileged backgrounds. We explore the channels through which education affects equity holdings using the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey and find that, controlling for family fixed effects, increased cognition and features associated with having a white collar job appear to be the main channels.},

Risk sharing from capital gains, at about 6\%, is higher than risk sharing from factor income flows for European Union countries and OECD countries. Risk sharing from factor income flows is higher for euro zone countries, at 14\%, reflecting increased international asset and liability holdings in the euro area.},

We document the following patterns: a) there was an increase in leverage for investment banks prior to the sub-prime crisis; b) there was no visible increase in leverage for the typical commercial bank and non-financial firm; c) off-balance-sheet items constitute a big fraction of assets, especially for large commercial banks in the US, whereas investment banks do not report these items; d) the leverage ratio is procyclical for investment banks and for large commercial banks in the US; e) banks in emerging markets with tighter bank regulation and stronger investor protection experienced significantly less deleveraging during the crisis. The results suggest that excessive risk taking before the crisis was not easily detectable because the risk involved the quality rather than the quantity of assets.},

We document a positive, highly robust, relationship between firm-level foreign ownership and volatility of value added. This relationship holds cross-sectionally and in panels with firm fixed effects where the relationship captures within-firm variation over time. Considering domestic firms with assets in foreign countries, we document that it is international diversification, rather than the nationality of the owner, that explains this positive correlation. Our results can also be found at the aggregate level, where we show that region-level volatility is correlated positively with foreign investment in the region. We show that this positive relation between aggregate volatility and foreign investment can be explained by the granularity of the firm size distribution and the fact that foreign ownership is concentrated among the largest firms.},

States increase benefits or lower taxes when Unemployment Trust fund balances are high, consistent with a desired target level of savings. This can be explained by the representative state program behaving like a Carroll (1992) buffer-stock consumer who trades off a desire to expend savings (impatience) against the fear of running out of funds (risk aversion). We calibrate the model to the data and find that statistics from model simulations match similar statistics produced from the data for reasonable levels of risk aversion and impatience.},

We find that negative home equity is not a significant barrier to job-related mobility because the benefits of accepting an out-of-area job outweigh the costs of moving. This pattern holds even if homeowners are not able to default on their mortgages.},

This paper describes the development of a firm-level global panel dataset for public and private companies based on the administrative micro-dataset ORBIS, provided commercially by Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing (BvD). The ORBIS database provides data on firms' financial and productive activities from balance sheets and income statements together with detailed information on firms' domestic and international ownership structure for over 130 million companies across the world. Researchers need to overcome several challenges before making the database usable for research. First, the database is not designed for large downloads that is essential for an econometric analysis. Second, there are several inherent biases in the database that affect the download process and lead to missing information. Third, the raw data may contain a number of irregularities which, if not dealt with, will result in data loss during a standard cleaning procedure. In combination, these issues cause minimal coverage of small firms, extensive missing data, and poor national representation. We give detailed instructions on the data gathering process from ORBIS in terms of downloading methodology and cleaning procedure so that a researcher can construct a database that is nationally representative with minimal missing information. We provide examples from several European countries to present the process and discuss the resulting dataset in detail.},

 abstract = {Individuals face significant late-in-life risks, including needing long-term care (LTC). Yet, they hold little long-term care insurance (LTCI). Using both “strategic survey questions,” which identify preferences, and stated demand questions, this paper investigates the degree to which a fundamental lack of interest and poor product features determine low LTCI holdings. It estimates a rich set of individual-level preferences and uses a life-cycle model to predict insurance demand, finding that better insurance would be far more widely held than are products in the market. Comparing stated and model-predicted demand shows that flaws in existing products provide a significant, but partial, explanation for this under-insurance puzzle.},

	   abstract = {Despite massive large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by central banks around the world since the global financial crisis, there is a lack of empirical evidence on whether and how these programs affect the real economy. Using rich borrower-linked mortgage-market data, we document that there is a “flypaper effect” of LSAPs, where the transmission of unconventional monetary policy to interest rates and (more importantly) origination volumes depends crucially on the assets purchased and degree of segmentation in the market. For example, QE1, which involved significant purchases of GSE-guaranteed mortgages, increased GSE-eligible mortgage originations significantly more than the origination of GSE-ineligible mortgages. In contrast, QE2's focus on purchasing Treasuries did not have such differential effects. We find that the Fed's purchase of MBS (rather than exclusively Treasuries) during QE1 resulted in an additional \$600 billion of refinancing, substantially reduced interest payments for refinancing households, led to a boom in equity extraction, and increased refinancing mortgagors’ consumption by an additional \$76 billion. This de facto allocation of credit across mortgage market segments, combined with sharp bunching around GSE eligibility cutoffs, establishes an important complementarity between monetary policy and macroprudential housing policy. Our counterfactual simulations estimate that relaxing GSE eligibility requirements would have significantly increased refinancing activity in response to QE1, including a 20\% increase in equity extraction by households. Overall, our results imply that central banks could most effectively provide unconventional monetary stimulus by supporting the origination of debt that would not be originated otherwise.},

This is inconsistent with the Uzawa Growth Theorem. We extend Uzawa's theorem to show that the introduction of human capital accumulation in the standard way does not resolve the puzzle. However, balanced growth is possible if schooling is endogenous and capital is more complementary with schooling than with raw labor. We describe balanced growth paths for a variety of neoclassical growth models with capital-augmenting technological progress and endogenous schooling. The balanced growth path in an overlapping-generations model in which individuals choose the duration of their education matches key features of the U.S. economic record.},

	   abstract = {We provide new facts on the debt dynamics leading up to the financial crisis of 2007. Earlier research suggests that distortions in the supply of mortgage credit, evidenced by a decoupling of credit flow from income growth, may have caused the rise in house prices and the subsequent housing market collapse. This paper shows that the increase in mortgage originations was shared across the whole distribution of borrowers, and that middle- and high-income borrowers made up the majority of originations even at the peak of the boom. Compared to prior years, middle- and high-income borrowers (not the poor), as well as those with medium and high credit scores, made up a much larger share of delinquencies in the crisis relative to earlier years. We show that the relation between individual mortgage size and income growth during the housing boom was always strongly positive, also in line with previous periods (and independent of how income is measured). These results are most consistent with an expectations based view of the financial crisis in which both homebuyers and lenders were buying into increasing housing values and defaulted once prices dropped. },

type = {Discussion Papers},
number = {15-010},
abstract = {This paper presents novel tests of competing models of intertemporal consumption behavior using unique European administrative panel data on income, spending and assets. I estimate the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of â€˜liquidityâ€™ -the debt response to a change in borrowing capacity- using changes in credit card limits in a randomized controlled trial implemented in September 2014 involving fifty-five thousand individuals. I obtain four empirical results: First, borrowing constraints change consumption dynamics even when they are not strictly binding. Two-thirds of the population accumulate a significant average of 20 cent of debt per dollar limit increase, relative to the control group. Second, the heterogeneity of the MPC is exclusively in line with precautionary models, a decreasing function of cash-on-hand. Third, the debt response to liquidity and credit card utilization are stationary. Fourth, additional liquidity is spent mostly on durables and services using installments, with a smaller fraction spent on non-durables and taken out as cash advances. I then use a workhorse Bewley model with realistic income risk and show that the joint dynamics of consumption, debt and the balance sheet in response to a change in borrowing constraints can be used to calibrate and test intertemporal models. Debt response to liquidity shocks identifies preference parameters via a simulated moments estimator. Hump-shaped debt response and mean-reverting credit card utilization are not consistent with myopia as the underlying preferences.},

                  the rebates in 2008 provided low \&quot;bang for the
                  buck\&quot; as economic stimulus. Putting cash into
                  the hands of the consumers who use it to save or pay
                  off debt boosts their well-being, but it does not
                  necessarily make them spend. Low-income individuals
                  were particularly likely to use the rebate to pay
                  off debt.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another

A key reason for using administrative data to measure top shares is to overcome the under-representation of families at the very top that plagues most household surveys. However, using tax records alone restricts the unit of analysis for measuring economic resources, limits the concepts of income and wealth being measured, and imposes a rigid correlation between income and wealth. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) solves the under-representation problem by combining administrative and survey data (Bricker et al, 2014). Administrative records are used to select the SCF sample and verify that high-end families are appropriately represented, and the survey is designed to measure comprehensive concepts of income and wealth at the family level. The SCF shows high and rising top income and wealth shares, as in the ad ministrative tax data. However, unadjusted, the levels and growth based on administrative tax data alone appear to be substantially larger. By constraining the SCF to be conceptually comparable, we reconcile the differences, and show the extent to which restrictions and rigidities needed to estimate top income and wealth shares in the administrative data bias up levels and growth rates.},

                  stability of risk preferences. Over a 17-month
                  period, we elicited risk preferences from subjects
                  chosen to be representative of the adult Danish
                  population.  During this period we revisited many of
                  these subjects and repeated a risk aversion
                  elicitation task. We find some variation in risk
                  attitudes over time, but we do not detect a general
                  tendency for risk attitudes to increase or decrease
                  over a 17-month span. The results also suggest that
                  risk preferences are state contingent with respect
                  to personal finances.},

We derive analytical expressions for the dynamics of consumption, hours, and earnings of two earners in the presence of correlated wage shocks, nonseparability, progressive taxation, and asset accumulation. The model is estimated using panel data for hours, earnings, assets, and consumption. We focus on family labor supply as an insurance mechanism and find strong evidence of smoothing of permanent wage shocks. Once family labor supply, assets, and taxes are properly accounted for there is little evidence of additional insurance. (JEL D12, D14, D91, J22, J31)},

  abstract =	 {There is abundant evidence, some of it reviewed in
                  this paper, that personality traits are
                  substantially influenced by the genes. Much remains
                  to be understood about how and why this is the
                  case. We argue that placing the behavior genetics of
                  personality in the context of epidemiology,
                  evolutionary psychology, and neighboring
                  psychological domains such as interests and
                  attitudes should help lead to new insights.  We
                  suggest that important methodological advances, such
                  as measuring traits from multiple viewpoints, using
                  large samples, and analyzing data by modern
                  multivariate techniques, have already led to major
                  changes in our view of such perennial puzzles as the
                  role of “unshared environment” in personality. In
                  the long run, but not yet, approaches via molecular
                  genetics and brain physiology may also make decisive
                  contributions to understanding the heritability of
                  personality traits.  We conclude that the behavior
                  genetics of personality is alive and flourishing but
                  that there remains ample scope for new growth and
                  that much social science research is seriously
                  compromised if it does not incorporate genetic
                  variation in its explanatory models.},

  abstract = {This paper estimates the degree of stickiness in aggregate consumption growth (sometimes interpreted as reflecting consumption habits) for thirteen advanced economies. We find that after controlling for measurement error, consumption growth has a high degree of autocorrelation, with a stickiness parameter of about 0.7 on average across countries. The sticky consumption growth model outperforms the random walk model of Hall (1978) and typically fits the data better than the popular Mankiw (1989) model, though in a few countries, the sticky consumption growth and Campbell-Mankiw models work about equally well. },

  abstract =	 {We examine whether the behavior of current account
                  balances changed in the years preceding the global
                  crisis of 2008-09, and assess the prospects for
                  global imbalances in the post-crisis period. Changes
                  in the budget balance are an important factor
                  affecting current account balances for deficit
                  countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. The effect
                  of the “saving glut variables” on current account
                  balances has been relatively stable for emerging
                  market countries, suggesting that those factors
                  cannot explain the bulk of their recent current
                  account movements. We also find the 2006-08 period
                  to constitute a structural break for emerging market
                  countries, and to a lesser extent, for
                  industrialized countries. We attribute the anomalous
                  behavior of pre-crisis current account balances to
                  stock market performance and real housing
                  appreciation; fiscal procyclicality and the stance
                  of monetary policy do not matter as much. Household
                  leverage also appears to explain some of the
                  standard model’s prediction errors.  Looking
                  forward, U.S., fiscal consolidation alone cannot
                  induce significant deficit reduction. For China,
                  financial development might help shrink its current
                  account surplus, but only when it is coupled with
                  financial liberalization. These findings suggest
                  that unless countries implement substantially more
                  policy change, global imbalances are unlikely to
                  disappear.},

                  Using data on identical and fraternal twins matched
                  with data on their savings behavior, we find that an
                  individual's savings propensity is governed by both
                  genetic predispositions, social transmission from
                  parents to their children, and gene-environment
                  interplay where certain environments moderate
                  genetic influences. Genetic variation explains about
                  35 percent of the variation in savings rates across
                  individuals, and this genetic effect is stronger in
                  less constraining, high socioeconomic status
                  environments. Parent-child transmission influences
                  savings for young individuals and those who grew up
                  in a family environment with less competition for
                  parental resources. Individual-specific life
                  experiences is a very important explanation for
                  behavior in the savings domain, and strongest in
                  urban communities. In a world progressing rapidly
                  towards individual retirement savings autonomy,
                  understanding the origins of individuals' savings
                  behavior are of key importance to economists as well
                  as policy makers.},

                  Study in Robust Estimation},
  institution =	 {National Bureau of Economic Research},
  year =	 1991,
  type =	 {Working Paper},
  number =	 3802,
  month =	 {August},
  abstract =	 {The paper uses a previously unexploited data set --
                  the Michigan Survey of Consumer Finances -- to ask
                  whether the finding that consumption tracks current
                  income more closely than is consistent with the
                  permanent income hypothesis can be attributed solely
                  or partially to borrowing constraints. Using
                  household data on income and asset stocks, the paper
                  studies the saving side of the consumption/saving
                  decision, and thus provides inferences on a
                  comprehensive concept of consumption.  To limit the
                  influence of outliers, the paper uses a robust
                  instrumental variables estimator, and argues that
                  achieving robustness with respect to leverage points
                  is actually simpler, both conceptually and
                  computationally, in an instrumental variables
                  context than in the OLS context. The results
                  indicate that households do use asset stocks to
                  smooth their consumption, although this smoothing is
                  far from complete. However, there is no evidence
                  that the excess sensitivity of consumption to
                  current income is caused by borrowing
                  constraints. Compared to the conventional results,
                  the robust instrumental variables estimates are more
                  stable across different subsamples, more consistent
                  with the theoretical specification of the model, and
                  indicate that some of the most striking findings in
                  the conventional results were attributable to a
                  single, highly unusual observation.},

  abstract =	 {This paper studies the cyclical nature of individual
                  income risk using a confidential dataset from the
                  U.S. Social Security Administration, which contains
                  (uncapped) earnings histories for millions of
                  individuals.  The base sample is a nationally
                  representative panel containing 10 percent of all
                  U.S. males from 1978 to 2010. We use these data to
                  decompose individual income growth during recessions
                  into “between-group” and “within-group”
                  components. We begin with the behavior of
                  within-group shocks. Contrary to past research, we
                  do not find the variance of idiosyncratic income
                  shocks to be countercyclical. Instead, it is the
                  left-skewness of shocks that is strongly
                  countercyclical.  That is, during recessions, the
                  upper end of the shock distribution collapses—large
                  upward income movements become less likely—whereas
                  the bottom end expands—large drops in income become
                  more likely.  Thus, while the dispersion of shocks
                  does not increase, shocks become more left skewed
                  and, hence, risky during recessions. Second, to
                  study between-group differences, we group
                  individuals based on several observable
                  characteristics at the time a recession hits. One of
                  these characteristics—the average income of an
                  individual at the beginning of a business cycle
                  episode—proves to be an especially good predictor of
                  fortunes during a recession: prime-age workers that
                  enter a recession with high average earnings suffer
                  substantially less compared with those who enter
                  with low average earnings (which is not the case
                  during expansions). Finally, we find that the
                  cyclical nature of income risk is dramatically
                  different for the top 1 percent compared with all
                  other individuals—even relative to those in the top
                  2 to 5 percent. },

                  that are sustained for at least 8 years and identify
                  more than 80 such episodes since the 1950s. Growth
                  accelerations tend to be correlated with increases

                  depreciations. Political-regime changes are
                  statistically significant predictors of growth
                  accelerations. External shocks tend to produce

                  preferences. This article develops a measure of
                  relative risk tolerance using responses
                  tohypothetical income gambles in the Health and
                  Retirement Study. In contrast to most survey
                  measures that produce an ordinal metric, thisarticle
                  shows how to construct a cardinal proxy for the risk
                  tolerance of each survey respondent. The article
                  also shows how to accountfor measurement error in
                  estimating this proxy and how to obtain consistent
                  regression estimates despite the measurement
                  error. The risktolerance proxy is shown to explain
                  differences in asset allocation across households.},

                  5-HTTLPR {\it s/s} allele carriers take 28\% less
                  risk than those carrying the {\it s/l} or {\it l/l}
                  alleles of the gene. DRD4 7-repeat allele carriers
                  take 25\% more risk than individuals without the
                  7-repeat allele. These findings contribute to the
                  emerging literature on the genetic determinants of
                  economic behavior.},

                  measure. We estimate time preferences using a
                  structural buffer stock consumption model and the
                  Method of Simulated Moments. The model includes
                  stochastic labor income, liquidity constraints,
                  child and adult dependents, liquid and illiquid
                  assets, revolving credit, retirement, and discount
                  functions that allow short-run and long-run discount
                  rates to differ. Data on retirement wealth
                  accumulation, credit card borrowing, and
                  consumption-income comovement identify the
                  model. Our benchmark estimates imply a 40\%
                  short-term annualized discount rate and a 4.3\%
                  long-term annualized discount rate. Almost all
                  specifications reject the restriction to a constant
                  discount rate. Our quantitative results are
                  sensitive to assumptions about the return on
                  illiquid assets and the coefficient of relative risk
                  aversion. When we jointly estimate the coefficient
                  of relative risk aversion and the discount function,
                  the short-term discount rate is 15\% and the
                  long-term discount rate is 3.8\%.},

                  posits that self-control problems causes individuals
                  to depart substantially from rational behavior. I
                  show that this model can explain how the consumption
                  of individuals at or near retirement vary with
                  changes in different types of financial
                  assets. Specifically, consumption spending is
                  sensitive to changes in income and in liquid assets,
                  but not very sensitive to changes in the value of
                  other types of assets such as houses and social
                  security (even though the value of non-liquid assets
                  is relatively large for most of the households in
                  the sample). In general, the evidence presented here
                  favors the Behavioral Life-Cycle Model over the
                  conventional life-cycle model even when liquidity
                  constraints are introduced.}

  abstract =	 {A key rationale for fiscal stimulus is to boost
                  consumption when aggregate demand is perceived to be
                  inefficiently low. We examine the ability of the
                  government to increase consumption by evaluating the
                  impact of the 2009 ``Cash for Clunkers'' program on
                  short and medium run auto purchases. Our empirical
                  strategy exploits variation across U.S. cities in
                  ex-ante exposure to the program as measured by the
                  number of ``clunkers'' in the city as of the summer
                  of 2008. We find that the program induced the
                  purchase of an additional 360,000 cars in July and
                  August of 2009. However, almost all of the
                  additional purchases under the program were pulled
                  forward from the very near future; the effect of the
                  program on auto purchases is almost completely
                  reversed by as early as March 2010 -- only seven
                  months after the program ended. The effect of the
                  program on auto purchases was significantly more
                  short-lived than previously suggested. We also find
                  no evidence of an effect on employment, house
                  prices, or household default rates in cities with
                  higher exposure to the program.},

  abstract =	 {This paper examines the hypothesis that the
                  persistence of low spatial and marital mobility in
                  rural India, despite increased growth rates and
                  rising inequality in recent years, is due to the
                  existence of sub-caste networks that provide mutual
                  insurance to their members.  Unique panel data
                  providing information on income, assets, gifts,
                  loans, consumption, marriage, and migration are used
                  to link caste networks to household and aggregate
                  mobility. Our key finding, consistent with the
                  hypothesis that local risk-sharing networks restrict
                  mobility, is that among households with the same
                  (permanent) income, those in higher-income caste
                  networks are more likely to participate in
                  caste-based insurance arrangements and are less
                  likely to both out-marry and out-migrate. At the
                  aggregate level, the networks appear to have coped
                  successfully with the rising inequality within
                  sub-castes that accompanied the Green
                  Revolution. The results suggest that caste networks
                  will continue to smooth consumption in rural India
                  for the foreseeable future, as they have for
                  centuries, unless alternative consumption-smoothing
                  mechanisms of comparable quality become available.},

                  movements in consumer sentiment and stock prices. At
                  the aggregate level, the two share a strong
                  contemporaneous relationship: an increase in equity
                  values boosts sentiment. However, I examined the
                  nature of the relationship between the two. Does an
                  increase in stock prices raise aggregate sentiment
                  because people are wealthier or because they use
                  movements in stock prices as an indicator of future
                  economic activity and potential labor income growth?
                  Using individual observations from the Michigan
                  survey I found results more consistent with the view
                  that people use movements in equity prices as a
                  leading indicator. Although the findings do not rule
                  out a traditional wealth effect, they do raise some
                  questions about the causal role of wealth in
                  aggregate spending.}

                  the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances. It also uses
                  time-series evidence on the comovement of stock
                  market wealth and various categories of consumer
                  spending to calibrate {"}the wealth effect.{"} It
                  concludes that in the year after a change in stock
                  market values, consumer spending is likely to rise
                  by between one and two cents for each dollar

                  of solutions to the Bellman equation in the presence
                  of unbounded returns. We introduce a new approach
                  based both on consideration of a metric on the space
                  of all continuous functions over the state space,
                  and on the application of some metric fixed point
                  theorems. With appropriate conditions we prove
                  uniqueness of solutions with respect to the whole
                  space of continuous functions. Furthermore, the
                  paper provides new sufficient conditions for the
                  existence of solutions that can be applied to fairly
                  general models. It is also proven that the fixed
                  point coincides with the value function and that it
                  can be approached by successive iterations of the
                  Bellman operator.},

We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations' tax records. Wealth concentration has followed a U-shaped evolution over the last 100 years: It was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The rise of wealth inequality is almost entirely due to the rise of the top 0.1\% wealth share, from 7\% in 1979 to 22\% in 2012--a level almost as high as in 1929. The bottom 90\% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth concentration is due to the surge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of total labor income in the economy. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.},

  abstract =	 {This article investigates the effects of stock
                  market wealth on consumer spending. Traditional
                  macroeconometric models estimate that a dollar's
                  increase in stock wealth boosts consumption by three
                  to seven cents.  With the substantial 1990s rise in
                  stock prices, the nature and magnitude of this
                  {"}wealth effect{"} have been much debated. After
                  describing the issues and previous research, I
                  present new evidence from a well-known consumer
                  survey. The results are broadly consistent with
                  life-cycle saving and a modest wealth effect: most
                  stockholders reported no appreciable effect of stock
                  prices on their saving or spending, but many
                  mentioned {"}retirement saving{"} in explaining
                  their behavior.}

                  autoregressive or moving average roots in univariate
                  time series, and structural change in multivariate
                  time series regression. The \&quot;problem\&quot; of
                  unit roots is cast more broadly as determining the
                  order of integration of a series; estimation,
                  inference, and confidence intervals are
                  discussed. The discussion of structural change
                  focuses on tests for parameter stability. Much
                  emphasis is on asymptotic distributions in these
                  nonstandard settings, and one theme is the general
                  applicability of functional central limit
                  theory. The quality of the asymptotic approximations
                  to finite-sample distributions and implications for
                  empirical work are critically reviewed.},

Due to monopolistically competitive pricing, higher-order expectations are crucial for aggregate inflation dynamics, as argued by Phelps (1983). And decisionmakers' subjective perceptions of current conditions are assumed to be of imperfect precision, owing to finite information processing capacity, as argued by Sims (2001). The model can explain highly persistent real effects of a monetary disturbance, and a delayed effect on inflation, as found in VAR studies.},

  abstract  = {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how
                   much, household income, wealth, and preference
                   heterogeneity amplify and propagate a macroeconomic
                   shock. We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of
                   2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
                   from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document
                   the patterns of household income, consumption and
                   wealth inequality before and during the Great
                   Recession. We then investigate how households in
                   different segments of the wealth distribution were
                   affected by income declines, and how they changed
                   their expenditures differentially during the
                   aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we
                   study several variants of a standard heterogeneous
                   household model with aggregate shocks and an
                   endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our
                   key finding is that wealth inequality can
                   significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate
                   shock, and it does so if the distribution features a
                   sufficiently large fraction of households with very
                   little net worth that sharply increase their saving
                   (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the recession
                   hits. We document that both these features are
                   observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role
                   that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
                   insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income
                   and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics
                   of business cycles.},

The MPCs vary across states; in particular, the MPC out of current income is higher in states where income is more persistent, and the MPC out of lagged income is lower in agricultural states. We show that the estimated MPCs can be matched by a model of forward-looking consumers that includes all of the following features: time aggregation, durable goods, impatience, credit constraints, and risk sharing.

In the space of little more than a year what had been seen as the age of wisdom was viewed as the age of foolishness. Almost overnight, belief turned into incredulity. Most accounts of the recent crisis focus on the symptoms and not the underlying causes of what went wrong. But those events, vivid though they remain in our memories, comprised only the latest in a long series of financial crises since our present system of commerce became the cornerstone of modern capitalism. Alchemy explains why, ultimately, this was and remains a crisis not of banking – even if we need to reform the banking system – nor of policy-making – even if mistakes were made – but of ideas. In this refreshing and vitally important book, former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King – an actor in this drama – proposes revolutionary new concepts to answer the central question: are money and banking a form of Alchemy or are they the Achilles heel of a modern capitalist economy? },

  abstract    = {This paper raises basic questions about the process of economic growth.  It questions the assumption, nearly universal since Solow's seminal contributions of the 1950s, that economic growth is a continuous process that will persist forever.  There was virtually no growth before 1750, and thus there is no guarantee that growth will continue indefinitely.  Rather, the paper suggests that the rapid progress made over the past 250 years could well turn out to be a unique episode in human history.  The paper is only about the United States and views the future from 2007 while pretending that the financial crisis did not happen.  Its point of departure is growth in per-capita real GDP in the frontier country since 1300, the U.K. until 1906 and the U.S. afterwards.  Growth in this frontier gradually accelerated after 1750, reached a peak in the middle of the 20th century, and has been slowing down since.  The paper is about "how much further could the frontier growth rate decline?"

The analysis links periods of slow and rapid growth to the timing of the three industrial revolutions (IR's), that is, IR #1 (steam, railroads) from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum) from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (computers, the web, mobile phones) from 1960 to present.  It provides evidence that IR #2 was more important than the others and was largely responsible for 80 years of relatively rapid productivity growth between 1890 and 1972.  Once the spin-off inventions from IR #2 (airplanes, air conditioning, interstate highways) had run their course, productivity growth during 1972-96 was much slower than before.  In contrast, IR #3 created only a short-lived growth revival between 1996 and 2004.  Many of the original and spin-off inventions of IR #2 could happen only once - urbanization, transportation speed, the freedom of females from the drudgery of carrying tons of water per year, and the role of central heating and air conditioning in achieving a year-round constant temperature.

Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007.  These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt.  A provocative "exercise in subtraction" suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades.},

                  consumption and family labor supply under
                  uncertainty. Profit functions are used to represent
                  intertemporally additive preferences and to yield
                  convenient characterizations of ``constant marginal
                  utility of wealth'' or ``Frisch'' demand functions.
                  Conditions on preferences derived that allow
                  additive fixed-effect specifications for the Frisch
                  demands. Data from the British Family Expenditure
                  Surveys from 1970-77 are used to derive panel-like
                  information on male labor supply and consumption for
                  several age cohorts over time. These data reproduce
                  standard life-cycle patterns of hours and wages, but
                  more detailed analysis shows that the theory is
                  incapable of offering a satisfactory common
                  explanation of the behavior of hours and wages over
                  both the business cycle and the life cycle.
                  Similarly, although the theory can explain the
                  life-cycle behavior of hours and consumption
                  separately, the same model cannot explain both,
                  essentially because of a failure in symmetry.},

  title     = {{L}ife-cycle models of consumption: {I}s the evidence consistent with the theory?},
  year      = {1987},
  abstract  = {The paper considers avariety of evidence that casts
                  light on the validity of the life-cycle model of
                  consumer behavior. In the first part of the paper,
                  simple non-parametric tests are used to examine
                  representative agent models of consumption and labor
                  supply. It seems extremely unlikely that post-war
                  United States evidence can usefully be explained by
                  such a model, at least if the assumption of
                  intertemporal separability is maintained. Changes in
                  aggregate consumption bear little relationship to
                  after tax real interest rates, and consumption has
                  tended to grow even during periods of negative real
                  interest rates. Joint consideration of consumption
                  and labor supply does nothing to resolve the
                  problems that arise when consumption is taken by
                  itself. It is argued that these results cast doubt,
                  not onlife-cycle theory itself, but on the
                  representative agent assumption; there is little
                  reason to suppose that changes inaggregate
                  consumption should be related to the real
                  interestrate.The second part of the paper is
                  concerned with the time-series representation of
                  disposable income and with it simplications for the
                  behavior of consumption under the assumptions of the
                  life-cycle model. If real disposable income is truly
                  a first-order autoregressive process in first
                  differences,a process that fits the data well and is
                  becoming increasing popular in the macro time-series
                  literature,then the life-cycle model implies that
                  changes in consumption should be more variable than
                  innovations in income, a prediction that is
                  manifestly false. Various possible resolutions of
                  this problem are reviewed, including habit formation
                  and alternative representations of disposable
                  income. The paper concludes with some evidence on
                  the excess sensitivity question, why it is that
                  consumption responds to anticipated changes in
                  income. Monte Carlo evidence supports the suggestion
                  made by Mankiw and Shapiro that the presence of time
                  trends can cause severe problems of inference in
                  models containing variables with unit roots, but the
                  results makeit seem unlikely that this is the cause
                  of the widespread excess sensitivity findings.},

  abstract = {This paper applies the standard rational
                  expectations competitive storage model to the study
                  of thirteen commodities. It explains the skewness,
                  and the existence of rare but violent explosions in
                  prices, coupled with a high degree of price
                  autocorrelation in more normal times. A central
                  feature of the model is the explicit recognition of
                  the fact that it is impossible for the market as a
                  whole to carry negative inventories, and this
                  introduces an essential non-linearity which carries
                  through into non-linearity of the predicted
                  commodity price series. For most of the thirteen
                  commodity prices, the behaviour of prices from one
                  year to the next conforms to the predictions of the
                  theory about conditional expectations and
                  conditional variances.  However, given the
                  non-linearity both of the model and of the actual
                  prices, such conformity is not enough to ensure that
                  the theory yields a complete account of the data. In
                  particular, the analysis does not yield a fully
                  satisfactory explanation for the high
                  autocorrelation observed in the data.},

  abstract            = {The permanent income hypothesis implies that, for
                  any cohort of people born at the same time,
                  inequality in both consumption and income should
                  grow with age. We investigate this prediction using
                  cohort data constructed from 11 years of household
                  survey data from the United States, 22 years from
                  Great Britain, and 14 years from Taiwan.  The data
                  show that within-cohort consumption and income
                  inequality measures do indeed increase with age in
                  the three economies and that the rate of increase is
                  similar in all three. According to the permanent
                  income hypothesis, the increase in inequality
                  reflects cumulative differences in the effects of
                  luck on consumption. Other models of intertemporal
                  choice--such as those with strong precautionary
                  motives or liquidity constraints--can limit or even
                  prevent the spread of inequality, as can insurance
                  arrangements that share risk across individuals. The
                  evidence on the spread of inequality can therefore
                  be used to help quantify the extent to which private
                  and social arrangements moderate the impact of risk
                  on the distribution of individual welfare.},

                  growth process within an overlapping generations
                  model. Our original interest was to enquire whether
                  the introduction of land into a growth model might
                  account for a ''virtuous'' circle in which saving-up
                  for land (or housing) generates growth and higher
                  land prices, generating further increases in saving,
                  and so on. Such an account is sometimes proposed for
                  high saving rates in East Asia, where mortgage
                  markets are limited or absent. Our analysis does not
                  support such a story. The user cost of land reduces
                  the resources available for consumption of
                  reproducible goods, so that the introduction of
                  intrinsically valuable land into a growth model
                  lowers the equilibrium stock of capital and raises
                  the equilibrium interest rate. On the asset side,
                  the presence of land causes life-cycle savings to be
                  reallocated away from productive capital towards
                  land. The social optimum in such a model is for land
                  to be nationalized and provided at zero rent. Land
                  markets, far from generating saving and growth, are
                  inimical to capital formation.},

                  has been disputed for 30 years. Although there are
                  better data than ever before, controversies are not
                  resolved. A major problem is that consumption
                  measured from household surveys, which is used to
                  measure poverty, grows less rapidly than consumption
                  measured in national accounts, in the world as a
                  whole and in large countries, particularly India,
                  China, and the United States. In consequence,
                  measured poverty has fallen less rapidly than
                  appears warranted by measured growth in poor
                  countries. One plausible cause is that richer
                  households are less likely to participate in
                  surveys. But growth in the national accounts is also
                  upward biased, and consumption in the national
                  accounts contains large and rapidly growing items
                  that are not consumed by the poor and not included
                  in surveys. So it is possible for consumption of the
                  poor to grow less rapidly than national consumption,
                  without any increase in measured inequality. Current
                  statistical procedures in poor countries understate
                  the rate of global poverty reduction, and overstate
                  growth in the world.},

                  not alive to experience them. Through the twentieth
                  century in the United States and other high-income
                  countries, growth in real incomes was accompanied by
                  a historically unprecedented decline in mortality
                  rates that caused life expectancy at birth to grow
                  by nearly 30 years. In the years just after World
                  War II, life expectancy gaps between countries were
                  falling across the world. Poor countries enjoyed
                  rapid increases in life-expectancy through the
                  1970s, with the gains in some cases exceeding an
                  additional year of life expectancy per year, though
                  the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the transition in Russia
                  and Eastern Europe have changed that situation. We
                  investigate the determinants of the historical
                  decline in mortality, of differences in mortality
                  across countries, and of differences in mortality
                  across groups within countries.  A good theory of
                  mortality should explain <I>all</I> of the facts we

  abstract            = {There is currently much debate about the
                  effectiveness of foreign aid and about what kind of
                  projects can engender economic development.  There
                  is skepticism about the ability of econometric
                  analysis to resolve these issues or of development
                  agencies to learn from their own experience. In
                  response, there is increasing use in development
                  economics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to
                  accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without
                  overreliance on questionable theory or statistical
                  methods. When RCTs are not possible, the proponents
                  of these methods advocate quasirandomization through
                  instrumental variable (IV) techniques or natural
                  experiments. I argue that many of these applications
                  are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful
                  for policy or understanding: two key issues are the
                  misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of
                  heterogeneity. I illustrate from the literature on
                  aid and growth. Actual randomization faces similar
                  problems as does quasi-randomization,
                  notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue
                  that experiments have no special ability to produce
                  more credible knowledge than other methods, and that
                  actual experiments are frequently subject to
                  practical problems that undermine any claims to
                  statistical or epistemic superiority. I illustrate
                  using prominent experiments in development and
                  elsewhere. As with IV methods, RCT-based evaluation
                  of projects, without guidance from an understanding
                  of underlying mechanisms, is unlikely to lead to
                  scientific progress in the understanding of economic
                  development.  I welcome recent trends in development
                  experimentation away from the evaluation of projects
                  and toward the evaluation of theoretical
                  mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects
                  of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being
                  refers to the emotional quality of an individual's
                  everyday experience—the frequency and intensity of
                  experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and
                  affection that make one's life pleasant or
                  unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts
                  that people have about their life when they think
                  about it. We raise the question of whether money
                  buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of
                  well-being. We report an analysis of more than
                  450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways
                  Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US
                  residents conducted by the Gallup Organization.  We
                  find that emotional well-being (measured by
                  questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and
                  life evaluation (measured by Cantril's
                  Self-Anchoring Scale) have different
                  correlates. Income and education are more closely
                  related to life evaluation, but health, care giving,
                  loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger
                  predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against
                  log income, life evaluation rises
                  steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log
                  income, but there is no further progress beyond an
                  annual income of \$75,000. Low income exacerbates
                  the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes
                  as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude
                  that high income buys life satisfaction but not
                  happiness, and that low income is associated both
                  with low life evaluation and low emotional
                  well-being.},

                  to examine how the Great Recession affected the
                  emotional and evaluative lives of the population. In
                  the fall of 2008 and lasting into the spring of
                  2009, at the bottom of the stock market, Americans
                  reported sharp declines in their life evaluation,
                  sharp increases in worry and stress, and declines in
                  positive affect. By the end of 2010, in spite of
                  continuing high unemployment, these measures had
                  largely recovered.  The SWB measures do a better job
                  of monitoring short-run levels of anxiety than the
                  medium-term evolution of the economy. Even very
                  large macroeconomic shocks will cause small and hard
                  to detect effects on SWB. Life evaluation questions
                  are extremely sensitive to question order
                  effects—asking political questions first reduces
                  reported life evaluation by an amount that dwarfs
                  the effects of even the worst of the crisis.},

  abstract      = {Between 1980 and the early 1990s the variability of
                  labor earnings growth rates across the prime-age
                  working population fell significantly.  This decline
                  and timing are consistent with other macro and micro
                  observations about growth variability that are
                  collectively referred to as the \&quot;Great
                  Moderation.\&quot; The variability of earnings
                  growth is negatively correlated with age at any
                  point in time, and the U.S. working age population
                  got older during this period because the Baby Boom
                  was aging. However, the decrease in variability was
                  roughly uniform across all age groups, so population
                  aging is not the source of the overall decline. The
                  variance of log changes also declined at multi-year
                  frequencies in such a way as to suggest that both
                  permanent and transitory components of earnings
                  shocks became more moderate. A simple identification
                  strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows
                  a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory
                  shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a
                  shift over time in the stochastic process occurred
                  even after controlling for age effects.},

  abstract = { We estimate the effects of deregulation of U.S. banking restrictions on interstate personal income insurance for the period 1970 to 2001. Interstate income insurance occurs when personal income reacts less than one-to-one to state-specific output shocks. We find that insurance improved after banking deregulation, with a larger effect in states where small businesses are more important and on proprietors' income than on other components of personal income. Our explanation centers on the role of banks as a prime source of small business finance and on the close intertwining of the personal and business finances of small business owners.
