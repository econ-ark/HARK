    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a one of the possible journeys into HARK - the Python package designed to solve economic models with the heterogeneous agents. As it is a \"journey\", it is not a one big tutorial, but a set of the links to the notebooks/other resources which will help you understand the different HARK objects and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This journey does not require a special skill in programing. However, we propose a few introductions to Python and object-oriented programing (OOP), to make you familiar with the basic concepts. Moreover, we assume some knowledge in the economic theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have found this journey, you probably have a concept of heterogeneous agent model, but here is a short recap. Think about a basic infinitely lived consumer problem as you know from first-year graduate courses (letting alone the companies and general equilibrium). Using the Bellman equation, we can write it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "V(M_t) &=& \\max_{C_t} U(C_t) + \\beta V(M_{t+1}), \\\\\n",
    "& s.t. & \\\\\n",
    "A_t &=& M_t - C_t, \\\\\n",
    "M_{t+1} &=& R (M_{t}-C_{t}) + Y_t, \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\beta <1$ is a discount factor, $C_t$ is a consumption, $A_t$ - assets, $Y_t$ - income and $U(C)$ is a standard CRRA utility function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(C)=\\frac{C^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume that every consumer faces some uncertainty on hers income (e.g. it follows AR (1) process), which is idiosyncratic - the realizations of each shock is (potentially) different for each agent. In this setting the bellman equation looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "V(M_t, Y_t) &=& \\max_{C_t} U(C_t) + E[\\beta V(M_{t+1}, Y_{t+1})], \\\\\n",

    "M_{t+1} &=& R (M_{t}-C_{t}) + Y_t, \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, finding a distribution of agent assets (consumption, savings) involves many much more advanced numerical tools than in the case of a representative agent. Obviously, this is more demanding to master. Moreover, the knowledge about involved numerical methods is less systematic, and often hard to find. It was mentioned in the HARK manual:\n",

    "\n",
    "This journey will help you mostly with using HARK in the first way. We do not elaborate here the numerical methods, however in the last sections you can find some guidance which were used and how the source code is structured.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Although using the prepared package is easier than writing your own solution (what sooner or later you will need to do if you create an original heterogeneous agent model), you still need some effort to comprehend the main classes and functionalities of HARK.

    "## 3 Few words about HARK structure\n",
    "\n",
    "HARK was written using OOP (we hope that you skimmed the tutorials and have some understanding of this). This means that different parts of the model, like different type of consumers', firms, general equilibrium conditions (if you have these components in the model) are implemented as different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such structure enables you to build your own models with different consumer type distributions / company structure (if you want some). Importantly, learning the package with a such structure implies learning the different types of objects (classes). In HARK there are two main classes: $\\texttt{Agent-type}$ (think consumers, macroeconomic models) and $\\texttt{Market}$ (think general equilibrium, macro models). As Agent-type objects are the attributes of the Market, we first present you this type (additionally, if you are interested only in microeconomic research, you may not want to study the Market class).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, only two classes  cannot accommodate the huge variety of the currently used models. Thus, each of the classes have subclasses and they have their own subclasses... In general more sophisticated class is a subclass. This journey will reflect this structure, by showing you first the most primitive models, then go ahead to the more fancy ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "NOTE\n",
    "***\n",
    "In OOP objects are organized in **classes** (the general structure of the objects) and more specific **subclasses**. The subclass inherits the methods and attributes from the its parent class. Thus everything which you can do with the object from a general class can be done with the object from its subclass. Therefore, in case of the economic models the basic one are always the parent classes of the more sophisticated ones. \n",

    " \n",
    "When you look at the [HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK) sources, you find the subdirectory called HARK. Next there is a script called \"core. py\". Surprisingly, you will not find this code in many of the subclasses which you learned during this journey! \n",

    "The reason for this is that HARK.core is a core of the package, kind of a framework  for all models which can be coded in HARK. It contains the general framework of the Agent-type classes (AgentType class) and for the market. The exact structure of modules in the HARK core you can find in the [manual](../HARKmanual/index.html) in section 0.2 General Purpose Tools. For the general structure of the AgentType and Market classes also look at the manual, for the sections 0.3 and 0.4 (you can skip the examples, as you already made a lot of them in the tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where are the subclasses which you learned during the journey? In HARK, the subclasses are in the separate directories. For the AgentType subclasses, you need to look at HARK.ConsumptionSaving directory. For example, $\\texttt{PerfForesightConsumerType}$ and $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ can be found in ConsIndShockModel.py.

    "However, knowing the structure of the code does not be very beneficial if you do not know the solution method! While for the perfect foresight consumer it is analytic, for the stochastic consumer (thus with the idiosyncratic or the aggregate shocks) the policy functions are solved by the **endogenous grid method**.\n",

    "The endogenous grid method is now widely used in the macroeconomic simulations. There are a few resources to learn it, we suggest professor Carroll [lecture notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/SolvingMicroDSOPs/). If you prefer a very quick version, we suggest appendix to the Kruger and Kindermann [paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20601.pdf) (they develop a little bigger model with a different notation, but the idea is the same).\n",

    "#### 6.2.2 Finding general equilibrium\n",
    "In the most basic case the rational expectations general equilibrium is found by updating the agents' expectations and the aggregate choices to the point when actual aggregated variables (like intrest rate or capital) are equal to the expected ones. However, refer to the papers cited in the notebooks, to understand the exact used mathods.    \n",

    "### 6.3 How to study HARK codes\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that this section gave you some idea how the HARK codes work. However, HARK contains a pretty high number of separate modules and directories. Here we give you some guidance how to start:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before you start make sure that you understand the endogenous grid method, and general framework structure for AgentType and Market from manual.\n",
    "- Start with the HARK.core, make sure that you see the connection between the structure in the manual and the code, check autodoc from the [HARK documentation](https://hark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/HARK.core.html) webpage. \n",
    "- Proceed to the ConsumptionSaving\\ConsIndShockModel.py and compare the tutorials with the source code.\n",
    "- Proceed to the ConsumptionSaving\\ConsAggShockModel.py and compare the tutorial on the Market class with the source code, check [autodoc](https://hark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/HARK.ConsumptionSaving.ConsAggShockModel.html).\n",
    "- When you want to learn any of the modules, always firstly check autodoc from the [HARK documentation](https://hark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/HARK.core.html) webpage.\n"
