    "This notebook explores the behavior of a consumer identical to the perfect foresight consumer described in \"A Gentle Introduction,\" except that now the model incorporates income uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, our new type of consumer receives two income shocks at the beginning of each period: a completely transitory shock $\\theta_t$ and a completely permanent shock $\\psi_t$.  Moreover, lenders will not let the agent borrow money such that his ratio of end-of-period assets $A_t$ to permanent income $P_t$ is less than $\\underline{a}$. As with the perfect foresight problem, this model can be framed in terms of $\\textit{normalized}$ variables, e.g. $m_t \\equiv M_t/P_t$.  (See [here](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory/) for all the theory).\n",

    "HARK represents agents with this kind of problem as instances of the class $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$.  To create an $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$, we must specify the same set of parameters as for a $\\texttt{PerfForesightConsumerType}$, as well as an artificial borrowing constraint $\\underline{a}$ and a sequence of income shock distributions $\\{F_t\\}$. It's easy enough to pick a borrowing constraint-- say, zero-- but how would we specify $F_t$?  Can't the joint distribution of permanent and transitory shocks be just about anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{Yes}$, and HARK can handle that.  However, the default behavior of $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ is that the distribution of permanent income shocks is mean one lognormal, and the distribution of transitory shocks is mean one lognormal with a point mass representing unemployment.  The distributions are independent of each other by default, and are approximated with $N$ point equiprobable distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make an infinite horizon instance of $\\texttt{IndShockConsumerType}$ with the same parameters as our original perfect foresight agent, plus the extra parameters to specify the income shock distribution and the artificial borrowing constraint. As before, we'll make a dictionary:\n",
