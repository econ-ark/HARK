    "We start with almost the simplest possible consumption model: A consumer with CRRA utility $U(C) = \\frac{C^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho}$ has perfect foresight about everything except the (stochastic) date of death, which occurs with probability $\\mathsf{D}$, implying  a \"survival probability\" $(1-\\mathsf{D}) < 1$.  Permanent labor income $P_t$ grows from period to period by a factor $\\Gamma_t$.  At the beginning of each period $t$, the consumer has some amount of market resources $M_t$ (which includes both market wealth and currrent income) and must choose how much of those resources to consume $C_t$ and how much to retain in a riskless asset $A_t$ which will earn return factor $R$. The agent receives a flow of utility $U(C_t)$ from consumption (with CRRA preferences) and geometrically discounts future utility flows by factor $\\beta$. Between periods, the agent dies with probability $\\mathsf{D}_t$, ending his problem.\n",
