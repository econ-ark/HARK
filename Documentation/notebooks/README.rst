Adding a notebook
-----------------

You can add a notebook here to be included in the docs by creating a symlink to an existing notebook.
This lets you keep them in the original place,
but also include them in your docs here.

This would be done with a command like this::

    ln -s ../../Examples/Gentle-Intro-To-HARK.ipynb .

That would create a symlink here to the ``Examples/Gentle-Intro-To-HARK.ipynb`` notebook.
