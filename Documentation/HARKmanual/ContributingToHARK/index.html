<!--l. 443--><p class="noindent" >This section provides an overview of how users can contribute new code to HARK, what sort of
contributions are most desired, and style conventions for the toolKit. Before attempting to
extend HARK, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with its features and models
by looking at the source code.
<!--l. 445--><p class="noindent" >
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1  </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001.1"></a>What Does HARK Want?</h4>
<!--l. 447--><p class="noindent" >The easiest and most straightforward way to contribute to HARK is by writing new general
purpose tools for inclusion in one of the top-level modules. This might be a commonly
known data analysis technique (e.g.&#x00A0;a kernel density estimator) for <span 
class="ectt-1200">HARKutilities</span>, an
optimization method (local or global) for <span 
class="ectt-1200">HARKestimation</span>, an interpolation method for
<span 
class="ectt-1200">HARKinterpolation</span>, etc. If you&#8217;ve found a technique useful in your own research and
believe it could be of use to others on entirely different projects, then it probably
belongs in HARK. Likewise, if you read through a HARK module expecting to find a
certain tool or function (because of similar functions that are present, or merely because
<span 
class="ecti-1200">it&#8217;s very useful</span>) but don&#8217;t, this is a good sign that HARK has a hole that you can
fill.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ContributingToHARK2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a> 
<!--l. 449--><p class="indent" >  Secondly, the development team wants to expand HARK to include more canonical models.
Most of the models available in the toolKit at the time of its public beta release concern agents
with (geometrically discounted) CRRA utility over a unitary consumption good, who receive
permanent and transitory shocks to income and have access to a single risk free asset. This is an
important class of models, but that description has an awful lot of qualifiers. In short, there are
many more common features of dynamic household models that are not yet in HARK, but would
be very valuable for the toolKit. New model contributions should &#8220;play nicely&#8221; with existing
models and tools, following HARK style guidelines (see sections 5.4 and 5.5) to the
greatest extent possible. For ideas of potential model extensions for HARK, see section
                                                                                        
                                                                                        
<span 
class="ecbx-1200">??</span>.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ContributingToHARK3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f2"></a> 
<!--l. 451--><p class="indent" >  Finally, contributions to HARK are not restricted to entirely new functionality. While we have
done our best to provide flexible frameworks and useful tools, we have almost certainly
overlooked an unexpected case that would not be (properly) handled by the toolKit as is.
Moreover, there might even be flaws in our solution or simulation methods. If you find a mistake
or error, we strongly encourage you to contribute a fix for the problem, or at least to flag it as
an Issue on GitHub so that someone else might. The &#8220;mistake&#8221; you find might not
even be in the code itself, but a deficiency in the documentation: a misnamed (or
incorrectly typed) parameter or return variable in the docstring, an incorrect (or missing)
comment, even a grammatical or spelling error. No matter how niggling, we want your
fix.
<!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >  For those who want to contribute to the HARK project without programming a new model or
digging through the code for errors and omissions, consider reading through the Issues page on
GitHub to see what other users have flagged for development. You might find several pieces of
&#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221; for you to quickly fix.
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2  </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.2"></a>Git and GitHub</h4>
<!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" >Git is a distributed version control system that has gained increasing popularity in the decade
since its creation; it is designed to enable collaboration and &#8220;non-linear workflow&#8221; among a
(potentially disperse) programming team. As HARK is to be developed by volunteer researchers
all around the world, git is an excellent fit for the toolKit. Originally designed by Linus Torvalds
as a command line tool, others have since extended git with further functionality and
a user interface more friendly to those more familiar with GUIs. Foremost among
these tools is GitHub.com, where the HARK project is hosted. This section provides a
brief overview of how to use GitHub to interact with (and potentially contribute to)
HARK.

<!--l. 493--><p class="noindent" >Before submitting to HARK, the development team would like you to make sure that
your intended contribution is listed as an Issue on the GitHub page. If you are going
to fix or address an Issue that is already posted, reply to that post with a note
indicating that you are about to work on it and an estimate of when you will make a
pull request for it. If you want to do something that no one has mentioned yet as
an Issue, make a new Issue on GitHub (briefly) describing what you intend to
do.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

This will both help prevent two people from working on the same thing (and one of them
potentially wasting time on it), and lets the development team know what&#8217;s coming. Moreover, if
you propose a contribution that is (a) already in HARK, (b) not in the spirit of HARK, or (c) a
fix for something that&#8217;s not actually broken, this gives the team a chance to let you know not to
spend effort on it.
<!--l. 495--><p class="indent" >  After creating a pull request to submit your contribution, it will be evaluated by one or more
members of the HARK team. Criteria that the HARK team will consider when choosing whether

      submission that introduces a model in a new module that could have easily been made
      as an extension of an existing module might be rejected. However, we acknowledge
      that there is value in providing a solver for a new model, and that a future contributor

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4  </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.4"></a>Naming Conventions</h4>
<!--l. 518--><p class="noindent" >Object naming conventions in HARK are fairly different than existing standards, and differ
somewhat between tool modules vs model or application modules. The following conventions
apply throughout HARK:

      case, first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. E.g. <span 
class="ectt-1200">approxLognormal</span>.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Function  and  method  names  should  accurately  and  concisely  describe  what  the
      function does; the first word in the name <span 
class="ecti-1200">must be a verb</span>.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ContributingToHARK11.html#fn10x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">10</sup></a></span><a

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Variable and class names <span 
class="ecti-1200">should not </span>have a verb as their first word.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Class names should use no underscores and capitalize the first letter of each word;
      moreover, a class name <span 
class="ecti-1200">must include a noun</span>. E.g.&#x00A0;<span 
class="ectt-1200">ConsPerfForesightSolver</span>.</li></ul>
<!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >  When naming variables in model modules, the HARK team strongly discourages using single
letter names, like <span 
class="ectt-1200">c </span>for consumption. Instead, we encourage contributors to use longer, more
descriptive variable names using additional words and common abbreviations to specify the
variable more precisely. In <span 
class="ectt-1200">/Documentation/NARK.pdf</span>, we list standard single letter variable
&#8220;bases&#8221; and an array of prefixes and suffixes to adjust them. Economic variables in model
modules should (usually) not use underscores, instead using camel case to the greatest extent
possible.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="ContributingToHARK12.html#fn11x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5002f11"></a> 
The development team prefers this standard so that users can translate between Python code
and LaTeX script with minimal work.
<!--l. 531--><p class="indent" >  Conventions for naming variables in HARK&#8217;s tool modules are significantly closer to more
commonly used standards. Variable names should be in all lower case, with underscores between
words, e.g.&#x00A0;<span 
class="ectt-1200">data_to_match</span>. The functions and classes in these modules are more general
and almost surely do not have any inherent &#8220;economic content&#8221;; they are numerical
or algorithmic objects, not variables that might appear in an equation in an article
for a (non-computational) economics journal. Variable names in application modules
(e.g.&#x00A0;the files that execute the <span 
class="ectt-1200">cstwMPC </span>estimations) are a mix of the conventions for tool
and model files, as appropriate for each variable. That is, variables that are directly
related to &#8220;economic variables&#8221; in model modules should follow those conventions, while
objects created solely for data manipulation or reporting should use the style of tool
modules.

<!--l. 535--><p class="noindent" >The HARK team wants the toolKit to be as accessible to users as possible; our greatest

 id="x1-6001f12"></a>  is
that a new user will open up our code, get hopelessly confused trying to read it, and then never
look at HARK again. To prevent this tragic outcome, we have tried hard to provide
comprehensive, accurate documentation and comments within the code describing our
methods.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Moreover, HARK uses the Sphinx utility to generate a website with <a 
href="https://econ-ark.github.io/HARK/" >online documentation</a> for all
of our tool and model modules, so that users can learn about what&#8217;s available in HARK without
digging through the source code. When making contributions to HARK, the development team
asks users to format their inline documentation to work with Sphinx by following a few simple
rules.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The top of every module should begin with a &#8220;docstring&#8221; providing a clear description
      of  the  contents  of  the  module.  The  first  sentence  should  concisely  summarize
      the  file,  as  it  may  appear  in  an  index  or  summary  of  all  modules  without  the
      remaining  sentences.  A  docstring  at  the  top  of  a  module  should  be  formatted
      as:<span class="footnote-mark"><a

      functions and methods, the docstring should be formatted as:

<!--l. 589--><p class="indent" >  Finally, if you write a new model module, the HARK team asks that you also provide a short
mathematical writeup of the model as a PDF. This document does not need to go into great
detail about the solution method for the model or the functions and classes included in
the module, merely specify the economic model and provide a summary of how it
is solved. See <span

this.
