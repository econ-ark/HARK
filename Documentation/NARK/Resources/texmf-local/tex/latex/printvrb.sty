%%% Uses moreverb.sty, Rainer Schopf author, 
%%% as method to send verbatim text to
%%% another file, 

%%% These commands allow user to type in text or math and
%%% have it print in more than one document,
%%% for example, print in an article and also in slides.

%%% This is done by sending fragments to a jobname.vrb file.
%%% Each fragment will have a unique name given as an argument
%%% to writetofile.

%%% 
\usepackage{moreverb}

\newwrite\verbatimout

%% The fragments will be sent to a new file called
%% the same name as the file they are found in with a
%% .vrb filename ending. (ie., test.tex ==> test.vrb)
%% They will also print in the originating .tex file
%% when LaTeX is run on the file twice (like the \tableofcontents
%% and cross-references).


%%% \begin{writetofile}{name}{your text}\end{writetofile}
%%% Notice that there are curly brackets surrounding the
%%% text you enter. These are necessary.

%%% (Name can include numbers or any symbols you want)

%%% Used:
%%% \begin{writetofile}{name}
%%% {my text}
%%% \end{writetofile}

\newcount\definitionnumber

%%% \namesinmargin will make name of fragment appear in margin.
%%% If this command isn't there, there will be no names in the margin.

%%% Using fragments in new file:

%%% for the fragments. 
%%% (jobname is the same as the filename of the source document)

%%% \namesinmargin will make names print as well as as printing
%%% the fragment.

%%% \printfrag{name} will bring in fragment defined in source file,
%%% and sent to jobname.vrb.

%%% \printfrag will save the problem of remembering to use 
%%% \csname ...\endcsname, and will check to see if fragment is defined
