This directory contains symlinks to the notebooks in the top level `examples/` directory.

These symlinks are referenced in the sphinx documentation, e.g. in `index.rst`.

`nbsphinx`, the sphinx notebook extension, sees the `.ipynb` extension, and resolves the link, properly converting the notebook into Sphinx themed HTML.
