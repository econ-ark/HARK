China's high net saving rate (approximately 25%) is a puzzle for economists, particularly in 
light of a consistently high income growth rate.  

If the last exercise made you worry that invoking difficult-to-measure "uncertainty" can explain
anything (e.g. "the stock market fell today because the risk aversion of the representative 
agent increased"), the next exercise may reassure you.  It is designed to show that there are 
limits to the phenomena that can be explained by invoking uncertainty.
 
It asks "what beliefs about uncertainty would Chinese consumers need to hold in order to generate a
saving rate of 25%, given the rapid pace of Chinese growth"?

The first step is to create the ConsumerType we want to solve the model for.

Model set up:
    * "Standard" infinite horizon consumption/savings model, with mortality and 
      permanent and temporary shocks to income
    * Markov state that represents the state of the Chinese economy (to be detailed later)
    * Ex-ante heterogeneity in consumers' discount factors

In our experiment, consumers will live in a stationary, low-growth environment (intended to 
approximate China before 1978).  Then, unexpectedly, income growth will surge at the same time
that income uncertainty increases (intended to approximate the effect of economic reforms in China
since 1978.)  Consumers believe the high-growth, high-uncertainty state is highly persistent, but
temporary.

HARK's MarkovConsumerType will be a very convient way to run this experiment.  So we need to
prepare the parameters to create that ConsumerType, and then create it.
