'''
High-level functions and classes for solving a wide variety of economic models.
The "core" of HARK is a framework for "microeconomic" and "macroeconomic"
models.  A micro model concerns the dynamic optimization problem for some type
of agents, where agents take the inputs to their problem as exogenous.  A macro
model adds an additional layer, endogenizing some of the inputs to the micro
problem by finding a general equilibrium dynamic rule.

        Parameters
        ----------
        solution_terminal : Solution
            A representation of the solution to the terminal period problem of
            this AgentType instance, or an initial guess of the solution if this
            is an infinite horizon problem.
        cycles : int
            The number of times the sequence of periods is experienced by this
            AgentType in their "lifetime".  cycles=1 corresponds to a lifecycle
            model, with a certain sequence of one period problems experienced
            once before terminating.  cycles=0 corresponds to an infinite horizon
            model, with a sequence of one period problems repeating indefinitely.
        time_flow : boolean
            Whether time is currently "flowing" forward or backward for this
            instance.  Used to flip between solving (using backward iteration)
            and simulating (etc).
        pseudo_terminal : boolean
            Indicates whether solution_terminal isn't actually part of the
            solution to the problem (as a known solution to the terminal period
            problem), but instead represents a "scrap value"-style termination.
            When True, solution_terminal is not included in the solution; when
            false, solution_terminal is the last element of the solution.
        tolerance : float
            Maximum acceptable "distance" between successive solutions to the
            one period problem in an infinite horizon (cycles=0) model in order
            for the solution to be considered as having "converged".  Inoperative

        Parameters
        ----------    
        agents : [AgentType]
            A list of all the AgentTypes in this market.    
        sow_vars : [string]
            Names of variables generated by the "aggregate market process" that should
            be "sown" to the agents in the market.  Aggregate state, etc.        
        reap_vars : [string]
            Names of variables to be collected ("reaped") from agents in the market
            to be used in the "aggregate market process".        
        const_vars : [string]
            Names of attributes of the Market instance that are used in the "aggregate
            market process" but do not come from agents-- they are constant or simply
            parameters inherent to the process.        
        track_vars : [string]
            Names of variables generated by the "aggregate market process" that should
            be tracked as a "history" so that a new dynamic rule can be calculated.
            This is often a subset of sow_vars.        
        dyn_vars : [string]
            Names of variables that constitute a "dynamic rule".        
        millRule : function
            A function that takes inputs named in reap_vars and returns an object
            with attributes named in sow_vars.  The "aggregate market process" that
            transforms individual agent actions/states/data into aggregate data to
            be sent back to agents.        
        calcDynamics : function
            A function that takes inputs named in track_vars and returns an object
            with attributes named in dyn_vars.  Looks at histories of aggregate
            variables and generates a new "dynamic rule" for agents to believe and
            act on.       
        act_T : int
            The number of times that the "aggregate market process" should be run
            in order to generate a history of aggregate variables.        
        tolerance: float
            Minimum acceptable distance between "dynamic rules" to consider the
            Market solution process converged.  Distance is a user-defined metric.
