To use the notebook you need a jupyter notebook with nbextension ([check](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for the installation instructions).
After the installation, you need to enable the packages: [exercise](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/exercise/readme.html) and [rubberband](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/rubberband/readme.html).
