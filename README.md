## Install

Install from [Anaconda Cloud](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) by running:

`conda install -c conda-forge econ-ark`

Install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) by running:

`pip install econ-ark`

Once HARK is installed, you can copy its example notebooks into a local working directory of your choice from within a Python environment:

```python
from HARK import install_examples

install_examples()
```

Follow the simple prompts to make an examples subdirectory inside the directory you specify. We recommend starting with /examples/Gentle-Intro/Gentle-Intro-to-HARK.ipynb.

## Usage

We start with almost the simplest possible consumption model: A consumer with CRRA utility

<div align="center">
  <img height="30px" src="https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/main/docs/images/usage-crra-utility-function.png">
</div>

has perfect foresight about everything except the (stochastic) date of death.

The agent's problem can be written in [Bellman form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) as:

<div align="center">
  <img height="80px" src="https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/main/docs/images/usage-agent-problem-bellman-form.png">
</div>

<br>

To model the above problem, start by importing the `PerfForesightConsumerType` model from the appropriate `HARK` module then create an agent instance using the appropriate parameters:

```python
from HARK.models import PerfForesightConsumerType

# Create an instance of a Perfect Foresight agent with otherwise default parameters
PFexample = PerfForesightConsumerType(cycles=0)
```
With `cycles=0`, the default parameters yield a single period cycle that repeats forever.

Once the model is created, ask the the agent to solve the problem with  its `solve()` method:

```python
# Tell the agent to solve the problem
PFexample.solve()
```

Solving the problem populates the agent's `solution` list attribute with solutions to each period of the problem. In the case of an infinite horizon model, there is just one element in the list, at **index-zero**.

You can retrieve the solution's consumption function from the `cFunc` attribute:

```python
# Retrieve the consumption function of the solution
PFexample.solution[0].cFunc
```

Or you can retrieve the solved value for human wealth normalized by permanent income from the solution's `.hNrm` attribute:

```python
# Retrieve the solved value for human wealth normalized by permanent income
PFexample.solution[0].hNrm
```

For a detailed explanation of the above example please see the demo notebook [_A Gentle Introduction to HARK_](https://docs.econ-ark.org/examples/Gentle-Intro/Gentle-Intro-To-HARK.html).

For more examples please visit the [examples](https://docs.econ-ark.org/docs/overview/index.html) section of the [documentation](https://docs.econ-ark.org/index.html), or the [econ-ark/DemARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/DemARK) repository.

The examples can also be copied to a local working directory for you to run and investigate; see the Install section above.

## Introduction

### For Students: A Gentle Introduction to HARK

Most of what economists have done so far with 'big data' has been like what Kepler did with astronomical data: Organizing the data, and finding patterns and regularities and interconnections.

An alternative approach called 'structural modeling' aims to do, for economic data, what Newton did for astronomical data: Provide a deep and rigorous mathematical (or computational) framework that distills the essence of the underlying behavior that produces the 'big data.'

The notebook [_A Gentle Introduction to HARK_](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/DemARK/main?filepath=notebooks/Gentle-Intro-To-HARK-PerfForesightCRRA.ipynb) details how you can easily utilize our toolkit for structural modeling. Starting with a simple [Perfect Foresight Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_expectations) we solve an agent problem, then experiment with adding [income shocks](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(economics)>) and changing constructed attributes.

### For Economists: Structural Modeling with HARK

Dissatisfaction with the ability of Representative Agent models to answer important questions raised by the Great Recession has led to a strong movement in the macroeconomics literature toward 'Heterogeneous Agent' models, in which microeconomic agents (consumers; firms) solve a structural problem calibrated to match microeconomic data; aggregate outcomes are derived by explicitly simulating the equilibrium behavior of populations solving such models.

The same kinds of modeling techniques are also gaining popularity among microeconomists, in areas ranging from labor economics to industrial organization. In both macroeconomics and structural micro, the chief barrier to the wide adoption of these techniques has been that programming a structural model has, until now, required a great deal of specialized knowledge and custom software development.

HARK provides a robust, well-designed, open-source toolkit for building such models much more efficiently than has been possible in the past.

Our [_DCEGM Upper Envelope_](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/DemARK/main?filepath=notebooks%2FDCEGM-Upper-Envelope.ipynb) notebook illustrates using HARK to replicate the [Iskhakov, Jørgensen, Rust, and Schjerning paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE643) for solving the discrete-continuous retirement saving problem.

The notebook [_Making Structural Estimates From Empirical Results_](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/econ-ark/DemARK/main?filepath=notebooks%2FStructural-Estimates-From-Empirical-MPCs-Fagereng-et-al.ipynb) is another demonstration of using HARK to conduct a quick structural estimation based on Table 9 of [_MPC Heterogeneity and Household Balance Sheets_ by Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik](https://www.ssb.no/en/forskning/discussion-papers/_attachment/286054?_ts=158af859c98).

### For Computational Economics Developers

HARK provides a modular and extensible open-source toolkit for solving heterogeneous-agent partial-and general-equilibrium structural models. The code for such models has always been handcrafted, idiosyncratic, poorly documented, and sometimes not generously shared from leading researchers to outsiders. The result being that it can take years for a new researcher to become proficient. By building an integrated system from the bottom up using object-oriented programming techniques and other tools, we aim to provide a platform that will become a focal point for people using such models.

HARK is written in Python, making significant use of libraries such as numpy and scipy which offer a wide array of mathematical and statistical functions and tools. Our modules are generally categorized into Tools (mathematical functions and techniques), Models (particular economic models and solvers) and Applications (use of tools to simulate an economic phenomenon).

For more information on how you can create your own Models or use Tools and Model to create Applications please see the [documentation](https://docs.econ-ark.org/docs/guides/quick_start.html#for-other-developers-of-software-for-computational-economics)
